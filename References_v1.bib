	Abstract = {The underlying cause of thrombosis in a large protein C (PC) deficient Vermont kindred appears to be multicausal and not explained by PC deficiency alone. We evaluated the contribution of coagulation factors to thrombin generation in this population utilizing a mathematical model that incorporates a mechanistic description of the PC pathway. Thrombin generation profiles for each individual were generated with and without the contribution of the PC pathway. Parameters that describe thrombin generation: maximum level (MaxL) and rate (MaxR), their respective times (TMaxL, TMaxR), area under the curve (AUC) and clotting time (CT) were examined in individuals $\pm$ PC mutation, $\pm$ prothrombin G20210A polymorphism and $\pm$ thrombosis history (DVT or PE). This family (n = 364) is shifted towards greater thrombin generation relative to the mean physiologic control. When this family was analyzed with the PC pathway, our results showed that: carriers of the PC mutation (n = 81) had higher MaxL and MaxR and greater AUC (all p<0.001) than non-carriers (n = 283); and individuals with a DVT and/or PE history (n = 13) had higher MaxL (p = 0.005) and greater AUC (p<0.001) than individuals without a thrombosis history (n = 351). These differences were further stratified by gender, with women in all categories generating more thrombin than males. These results show that all individuals within this family with or without PC deficiency have an increased baseline procoagulant potential reflective of increased thrombin generation. In addition, variations within the plasma composition of each individual can further segregate out increased procoagulant phenotypes, with gender-associated plasma compositional differences playing a large role.},

@article{Mitrophanov:2011aa,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The therapeutic potential of a hemostatic agent can be assessed by investigating its effects on the quantitative parameters of thrombin generation. For recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa)--a promising hemostasis-inducing biologic--experimental studies addressing its effects on thrombin generation yielded disparate results. To elucidate the inherent ability of rFVIIa to modulate thrombin production, it is necessary to identify rFVIIa-induced effects that are compatible with the available biochemical knowledge about thrombin generation mechanisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The existing body of knowledge about coagulation biochemistry can be rigorously represented by a computational model that incorporates the known reactions and parameter values constituting the biochemical network. We used a thoroughly validated numerical model to generate activated factor VII (FVIIa) titration curves in the cases of normal blood composition, hemophilia A and B blood, blood lacking factor VII, blood lacking tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and diluted blood. We utilized the generated curves to perform systematic fold-change analyses for five quantitative parameters characterizing thrombin accumulation.
RESULTS: The largest fold changes induced by increasing FVIIa concentration were observed for clotting time, thrombin peak time, and maximum slope of the thrombin curve. By contrast, thrombin peak height was much less affected by FVIIa titrations, and the area under the thrombin curve stayed practically unchanged. Comparisons with experimental data demonstrated that the computationally derived patterns can be observed in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: rFVIIa modulates thrombin generation primarily by accelerating the process, without significantly affecting the total amount of generated thrombin.},

@article{Mitrophanov:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Current mechanistic knowledge of protein interactions driving blood coagulation has come largely from experiments with simple synthetic systems, which only partially represent the molecular composition of human blood plasma. Here, we investigate the ability of the suggested molecular mechanisms to account for fibrin generation and degradation kinetics in diverse, physiologically relevant in vitro systems. We represented the protein interaction network responsible for thrombin generation, fibrin formation, and fibrinolysis as a computational kinetic model and benchmarked it against published and newly generated data reflecting diverse experimental conditions. We then applied the model to investigate the ability of fibrinogen and a recently proposed prothrombin complex concentrate composition, PCC-AT (a combination of the clotting factors II, IX, X, and antithrombin), to restore normal thrombin and fibrin generation in diluted plasma. The kinetic model captured essential features of empirically detected effects of prothrombin, fibrinogen, and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor titrations on fibrin formation and degradation kinetics. Moreover, the model qualitatively predicted the impact of tissue factor and tPA/tenecteplase level variations on the fibrin output. In the majority of considered cases, PCC-AT combined with fibrinogen accurately approximated both normal thrombin and fibrin generation in diluted plasma, which could not be accomplished by fibrinogen or PCC-AT acting alone. We conclude that a common network of protein interactions can account for key kinetic features characterizing fibrin accumulation and degradation in human blood plasma under diverse experimental conditions. Combined PCC-AT/fibrinogen supplementation is a promising strategy to reverse the deleterious effects of dilution-induced coagulopathy associated with traumatic bleeding.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the generation of thrombin by the tissue factor pathway. The model gives reasonable predictions of published experimental results without the adjustment of any parameter values. The model also accounts explicitly for the effects of serine protease inhibitors on thrombin generation. Simulations to define the optimum affinity profile of an inhibitor in this system indicate that for an inhibitor simultaneously potent against VIIa, IXa, and Xa, inhibition of thrombin generation decreases dramatically as the affinity for thrombin increases. Additional simulations show that the reason for this behavior is the sequestration of the inhibitor by small amounts of thrombin generated early in the reaction. This model is also useful for predicting the potency of compounds that inhibit thrombosis in rats. We believe that this is the first mathematical model of blood coagulation that considers the effects of exogenous inhibitors. Such a model, or extensions thereof, should be useful for evaluating targets for therapeutic intervention in the processes of blood coagulation.},

	Abstract = {A simulation model for the production of thrombin in plasma is presented. Values of the reaction rate constants as determined in purified systems are used and the model is tested by comparison of simulations of factor Xa, factor Va and thrombin generation curves with experimental data obtained in thromboplastin-activated plasma. Simulations of the effect of hirudin indicate that factor V is predominantly activated by thrombin and not by factor Xa. The model predicts a threshold value for the factor Xa production which, if exceeded, results in explosive and complete activation of prothrombinase. The dependence of this threshold value on different negative feedback reactions, e.g. the inactivation of thrombin and factor Xa by antithrombin III (+ heparin), is investigated. The threshold value, for control plasma in the range of 1-10 pM total factor Xa production, can be raised two orders of magnitude by accelerated inactivation of factor Xa and prothrombinase but is hardly affected by a tenfold increase in the rate of thrombin inactivation or by increased production of activated protein C. This latter effect, however, results in a more gradual input-response relation between factor Xa input and the extent of prothrombinase activation.},

In this paper, the first of two, the sparsely covered membrane (SCM) case is presented. This considers the limiting situation where platelet membrane binding sites are in excess, such that no membrane saturation or binding competition occurs. Under these conditions, the model predicts that the two positive feedback loops lead to multiple steady-state behavior in the range of intermediate mass transfer rates. It will be shown that this results in three parameter regions exhibiting very different thrombin production patterns. The model predicts the effect of flow on steady-state and dynamic thrombin production and attempts to explain the difference between venous and arterial thrombi. The reliance of thrombin production on precursor procoagulant protein concentrations is also assessed.},

The model predicted thrombin dynamics in recalcified whole blood (3-fold diluted) pretreated with convulxin (platelet GPVI activator) and picomolar levels of TF (0-14 pM). The model did not accurately predict coagulation times at low TF (0-0.7 pM). The simulation revealed that approximately 0.2 pM TF was the critical concentration to cause 50% of reactions containing 3-fold diluted whole blood to reach a clotting threshold of 0.05 U/ml thrombin by 1 h. Simulations of 1 nl of blood (5 pM TF) revealed small stochastic variations in thrombin initiation time, while 16.6 pl simulations were highly stochastic at this level of TF (50 molecules/16.6 pl). Further experiment and simulation will require evaluation of mechanisms of coagulation kinetics at subpicomolar levels of TF.},

	Abstract = {Manipulation of differentiation programs has therapeutic potential in a spectrum of human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line, HL-60, to Retinoic Acid (RA). HL-60 is a human myeloblastic leukemia cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation programs. Initially, we focused on the role of the BLR1 receptor in RA-induced differentiation and G1/0-arrest in HL-60. BLR1, a putative G protein-coupled receptor expressed following RA exposure, is required for RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation and causes persistent MAPK signaling. A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell-lines with and without RA. The current model described the dynamics of 729 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 1356 interactions. An ensemble strategy was used to compensate for uncertain model parameters. The ensemble of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1 and MAPK signaling. The ensemble of models also correctly predicted Rb and p47phox regulation and the correlation between p21-CDK4-cyclin D formation and G1/0-arrest following exposure to RA. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for future study. Taken together, the model presented here was a first step toward a systematic framework for analysis of programmed differentiation. These studies also demonstrated that mechanistic network modeling can help prioritize experimental directions by generating falsifiable hypotheses despite uncertainty.},

@article{Danforth:2012aa,
	Abstract = {In terms of its soluble precursors, the coagulation proteome varies quantitatively among apparently healthy individuals. The significance of this variability remains obscure, in part because it is the backdrop against which the hemostatic consequences of more dramatic composition differences are studied. In this study we have defined the consequences of normal range variation of components of the coagulation proteome by using a mechanism-based computational approach that translates coagulation factor concentration data into a representation of an individual's thrombin generation potential. A novel graphical method is used to integrate standard measures that characterize thrombin generation in both empirical and computational models (e.g max rate, max level, total thrombin, time to 2 nM thrombin ("clot time")) to visualize how normal range variation in coagulation factors results in unique thrombin generation phenotypes. Unique ensembles of the 8 coagulation factors encompassing the limits of normal range variation were used as initial conditions for the computational modeling, each ensemble representing "an individual" in a theoretical healthy population. These "individuals" with unremarkable proteome composition was then compared to actual normal and "abnormal" individuals, i.e. factor ensembles measured in apparently healthy individuals, actual coagulopathic individuals or artificially constructed factor ensembles representing individuals with specific factor deficiencies. A sensitivity analysis was performed to rank either individual factors or all possible pairs of factors in terms of their contribution to the overall distribution of thrombin generation phenotypes. Key findings of these analyses include: normal range variation of coagulation factors yields thrombin generation phenotypes indistinguishable from individuals with some, but not all, coagulopathies examined; coordinate variation of certain pairs of factors within their normal ranges disproportionately results in extreme thrombin generation phenotypes, implying that measurement of a smaller set of factors may be sufficient to identify individuals with aberrant thrombin generation potential despite normal coagulation proteome composition.},

@article{Butenas:2004aa,
	Abstract = {The presence of activation peptides (AP) of the vitamin K-dependent proteins in the phlebotomy blood of human subjects suggests that active serine proteases may circulate in blood as well. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the influence of trace amounts of key coagulation proteases on tissue factor-independent thrombin generation using three models of coagulation. With procoagulants and select coagulation inhibitors at mean physiological concentrations, concentrations of factor IXa, factor Xa, and thrombin were set either equal to those of their AP or to values that would result based upon the rates of AP/enzyme generation and steady state enzyme inhibition. In the latter case, numerical simulation predicts that sufficient thrombin to produce a solid clot would be generated in approximately 2 min. Empirical data from the synthetic plasma suggest clotting times of 3-5 min, which are similar to that observed in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood (4.3 min) initiated with the same concentrations of factors IXa and Xa and thrombin. Numerical simulations performed with the concentrations of two of the enzymes held constant and one varied suggest that the presence of any pair of enzymes is sufficient to yield rapid clot formation. Modeling of states (numerical simulation and whole blood) where only one circulating protease is present at steady state concentration shows significant thrombin generation only for factor IXa. The addition of factor Xa and thrombin has little effect (if any) on thrombin generation induced by factor IXa alone. These data indicate that 1) concentrations of active coagulation enzymes circulating in vivo are significantly lower than can be predicted from the concentrations of their AP, and 2) expected trace amounts of factor IXa can trigger thrombin generation in the absence of tissue factor.},

@article{Kuepfer:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Systems biology iteratively combines experimentation with mathematical modeling. However, limited mechanistic knowledge, conflicting hypotheses and scarce experimental data severely hamper the development of predictive mechanistic models in many areas of biology. Even under such high uncertainty, we show here that ensemble modeling, when combined with targeted experimental analysis, can unravel key operating principles in complex cellular pathways. For proof of concept, we develop a library of mechanistically alternative dynamic models for the highly conserved target-of-rapamycin (TOR) pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In contrast to the prevailing view of a de novo assembly of type 2A phosphatases (PP2As), our integrated computational and experimental analysis proposes a specificity factor, based on Tap42p-Tip41p, for PP2As as the key signaling mechanism that is quantitatively consistent with all available experimental data. Beyond revising our picture of TOR signaling, we expect ensemble modeling to help elucidate other insufficiently characterized cellular circuits.},

	Abstract = {Complete modeling of metabolic networks is desirable, but it is difficult to accomplish because of the lack of kinetics. As a step toward this goal, we have developed an approach to build an ensemble of dynamic models that reach the same steady state. The models in the ensemble are based on the same mechanistic framework at the elementary reaction level, including known regulations, and span the space of all kinetics allowable by thermodynamics. This ensemble allows for the examination of possible phenotypes of the network upon perturbations, such as changes in enzyme expression levels. The size of the ensemble is reduced by acquiring data for such perturbation phenotypes. If the mechanistic framework is approximately accurate, the ensemble converges to a smaller set of models and becomes more predictive. This approach bypasses the need for detailed characterization of kinetic parameters and arrives at a set of models that describes relevant phenotypes upon enzyme perturbations.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.},

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium dynamics are critical to cellular functions like pain transmission. Extracellular ATP plays an important role in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with the P2 family of surface receptors. In this study, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling in archetype sensory neurons. The model architecture, which described 90 species connected by 162 interactions, was formulated by aggregating disparate molecular modules from literature. Unlike previous models, only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants. Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters. Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter sets using a multi-objective thermal ensemble method. Each member of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near the optimal trade-off surface between the individual training data sets. The model quantitatively reproduced experimental measurements from dorsal root ganglion neurons as a function of extracellular ATP forcing. Hypothesized architecture linking phosphoinositide regulation with P2X receptor activity explained the inhibition of P2X-mediated current flow by activated metabotropic P2Y receptors. Sensitivity analysis using individual and the whole system outputs suggested which molecular subsystems were most important following P2 activation. Taken together, modeling and analysis of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling generated qualitative insight into the critical interactions controlling ATP induced calcium dynamics. Understanding these critical interactions may prove useful for the design of the next generation of molecular pain management strategies.},

Microfluidics was used to create in vitro environments that expose both the complex network and the model system to surfaces patterned with patches presenting clotting stimuli. Both systems displayed a threshold response, with clotting initiating only on isolated patches larger than a threshold size. The magnitude of the threshold patch size for both systems was described by the Damk{\"o}hler number, measuring competition of reaction and diffusion. Reaction produces activators at the patch, and diffusion removes activators from the patch. The chemical model made additional predictions that were validated experimentally with human blood plasma. These experiments show that blood can be exposed to significant amounts of clot-inducing stimuli, such as tissue factor, without initiating clotting. Overall, these results demonstrate that such chemical model systems, implemented with microfluidics, may be used to predict spatiotemporal dynamics of complex biochemical networks.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes microfluidic experiments with human blood plasma and numerical simulations to determine the role of fluid flow in the regulation of propagation of blood clotting. We demonstrate that propagation of clotting can be regulated by different mechanisms depending on the volume-to-surface ratio of a channel. In small channels, propagation of clotting can be prevented by surface-bound inhibitors of clotting present on vessel walls. In large channels, where surface-bound inhibitors are ineffective, propagation of clotting can be prevented by a shear rate above a threshold value, in agreement with predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion mechanism. We also demonstrate that propagation of clotting in a channel with a large volume-to-surface ratio and a shear rate below a threshold shear rate can be slowed by decreasing the production of thrombin, an activator of clotting. These in vitro results make two predictions, which should be experimentally tested in vivo. First, propagation of clotting from superficial veins to deep veins may be regulated by shear rate, which might explain the correlation between superficial thrombosis and the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Second, nontoxic thrombin inhibitors with high binding affinities could be locally administered to prevent recurrent thrombosis after a clot has been removed. In addition, these results demonstrate the utility of simplified mechanisms and microfluidics for generating and testing predictions about the dynamics of complex biochemical networks.},

Conversely, traditional approaches to analyzing cell signaling are narrow in scope and cannot easily make use of network-level data. Here, we combine network analysis and functional experimentation by using a hybrid approach in which graphs are converted into simple mathematical models that can be trained against biochemical data. Specifically, we created Boolean logic models of immediate-early signaling in liver cells by training a literature-based prior knowledge network against biochemical data obtained from primary human hepatocytes and 4 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines exposed to combinations of cytokines and small-molecule kinase inhibitors. Distinct families of models were recovered for each cell type, and these families clustered topologically into normal and diseased sets.},

Additionally, incorporating entities across different biological scales ranging from molecular to organismal in the same model is not trivial. Here, we present a framework called "querying quantitative logic models" (Q2LM) for building and asking questions of constrained fuzzy logic (cFL) models. cFL is a recently developed modeling formalism that uses logic gates to describe influences among entities, with transfer functions to describe quantitative dependencies. Q2LM does not rely on dedicated data to train the parameters of the transfer functions, and it permits straight-forward incorporation of entities at multiple biological scales. The Q2LM framework can be employed to ask questions such as: Which therapeutic perturbations accomplish a designated goal, and under what environmental conditions will these perturbations be effective? We demonstrate the utility of this framework for generating testable hypotheses in two examples: (i) a intracellular signaling network model; and (ii) a model for pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cell-cytokine interactions; in the latter, we validate hypotheses concerning molecular design of granulocyte colony stimulating factor.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cells process signals using complex and dynamic networks. Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce.
RESULTS: Here we present CellNOptR, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. CellNOptR features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape (CytoCopteR) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with CellNOptR are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the extrinsic or tissue factor (TF) pathway of blood coagulation is formulated and results from a computational study of its behavior are presented. The model takes into account plasma-phase and surface-bound enzymes and zymogens, coagulation inhibitors, and activated and unactivated platelets. It includes both plasma-phase and membrane-phase reactions, and accounts for chemical and cellular transport by flow and diffusion, albeit in a simplified manner by assuming the existence of a thin, well-mixed fluid layer, near the surface, whose thickness depends on flow. There are three main conclusions from these studies. (i) The model system responds in a threshold manner to changes in the availability of particular surface binding sites; an increase in TF binding sites, as would occur with vascular injury, changes the system's production of thrombin dramatically. (ii) The model suggests that platelets adhering to and covering the subendothelium, rather than chemical inhibitors, may play the dominant role in blocking the activity of the TF:VIIa enzyme complex. This, in turn, suggests that a role of the IXa-tenase pathway for activating factor X to Xa is to continue factor Xa production after platelets have covered the TF:VIIa complexes on the subendothelium. (iii) The model gives a kinetic explanation of the reduced thrombin production in hemophilias A and B.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) has arisen as an option for the control of life-threatening traumatic bleeding unresponsive to other means. The timing of administration, dosage, mortality, units of blood transfusion saved, risk of thrombotic events, and risk/benefits ratio are presently poorly defined. A Medline search from 1995 through March 2008 was conducted. All English language articles containing the terms "trauma" and "factor VII" or its variants were retrieved. Letters to the editor, animal studies, and general reviews were excluded. A total of 19 articles met inclusion criteria. These articles were then reviewed and stratified into three classes of evidence according to the quality assessment instrument developed by the Brain and Trauma Foundation. Levels of recommendation were developed. A total of 118 articles were identified. Only one Class I study was identified. This study demonstrated that three doses of rFVIIa given in blunt traumatic hemorrhage yielded a significant reduction of 2.6 of red blood cells used. These findings were not statistically significant for penetrating trauma patients. There was no reduction in mortality and no increase in thromboembolic events. Four Class II studies were identified; three showed a significant decrease of blood product usage and one demonstrated significant reductions in 24-hour and 30 day death from hemorrhage in patients receiving rFVIIa. The remaining 14 studies were Class III reviews of databases, registries, case series, and case reports. No identified study specifically addressed the cost/benefit analysis of rFVIIa usage in trauma hemorrhage. Utility of rFVIIa in trauma-associated hemorrhage remains controversial. There is Level I supporting the use of rFVIIa for blunt trauma patients only. There is no Class I evidence supporting decreased mortality or differences in thromboembolic events. Minimal effective dosing regimens and cost/benefit analyses have not yet been examined.},

	Abstract = {Inorganic polyphosphate is an abundant component of acidocalcisomes of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes. Human platelet dense granules strongly resemble acidocalcisomes, and we recently showed that they contain substantial amounts of polyphosphate, which is secreted upon platelet activation. We now report that polyphosphate is a potent hemostatic regulator, accelerating blood clotting by activating the contact pathway and promoting the activation of factor V, which in turn results in abrogation of the function of the natural anticoagulant protein, tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Polyphosphate was also found to delay clot lysis by enhancing a natural antifibrinolytic agent, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor. Polyphosphate is unstable in blood or plasma, owing to the presence of phosphatases. We propose that polyphosphate released from platelets or microorganisms initially promotes clot formation and stability; subsequent degradation of polyphosphate by blood phosphatases fosters inhibition of clotting and activation of fibrinolysis during wound healing.},

	Abstract = {A previously validated mathematical model of intravascular platelet deposition and tissue factor (TF)-initiated coagulation under flow is extended and used to assess the influence on thrombin production of the activation of factor XI (fXI) by thrombin and of the activation of factor IX (fIX) by fXIa. It is found that the importance of the thrombin-fXIa-fIXa feedback loop to robust thrombin production depends on the concentration of platelets in the blood near the injury. At a near-wall platelet concentration of ~250,000/μL, typical in vessels in which the shear rate is <200 s(-1), thrombin activation of fXI makes a significant difference only at low densities of exposed TF. If the near-wall platelet concentration is significantly higher than this, either because of a higher systemic platelet count or because of the redistribution of platelets toward the vessel walls at high shear rates, then thrombin activation of fXI makes a major difference even for relatively high densities of exposed TF. The model predicts that the effect of a severe fXI deficiency depends on the platelet count, and that fXI becomes more important at high platelet counts.},

@article{Bannish:2014ab,
	Abstract = {Fibrinolysis, the proteolytic degradation of the fibrin fibres that stabilize blood clots, is initiated when tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) activates plasminogen to plasmin, the main fibrinolytic enzyme. Many experiments have shown that coarse clots made of thick fibres lyse more quickly than fine clots made of thin fibres, despite the fact that individual thick fibres lyse more slowly than individual thin fibres. The generally accepted explanation for this is that a coarse clot with fewer fibres to transect will be degraded faster than a fine clot with a higher fibre density. Other experiments show the opposite result. The standard mathematical tool for investigating fibrinolysis has been deterministic reaction-diffusion models, but due to low tPA concentrations, stochastic models may be more appropriate. We develop a 3D stochastic multiscale model of fibrinolysis. A microscale model representing a fibre cross section and containing detailed biochemical reactions provides information about single fibre lysis times, the number of plasmin molecules that can be activated by a single tPA molecule and the length of time tPA stays bound to a given fibre cross section. Data from the microscale model are used in a macroscale model of the full fibrin clot, from which we obtain lysis front velocities and tPA distributions. We find that the fibre number impacts lysis speed, but so does the number of tPA molecules relative to the surface area of the clot exposed to those molecules. Depending on the values of these two quantities (tPA number and surface area), for given kinetic parameters, the model predicts coarse clots lyse faster or slower than fine clots, thus providing a possible explanation for the divergent experimental observations.},

	Abstract = {Fibrinolysis is the enzymatic degradation of the fibrin mesh that stabilizes blood clots. Experiments have shown that coarse clots made of thick fibres sometimes lyse more quickly than fine clots made of thin fibres, despite the fact that individual thick fibres lyse more slowly than individual thin fibres. This paper aims at using a 1D continuum reaction-diffusion model of fibrinolysis to elucidate the mechanism by which coarse clots lyse more quickly than fine clots. Reaction-diffusion models have been the standard tool for investigating fibrinolysis, and have been successful in capturing the wave-like behaviour of lysis seen in experiments. These previous models treat the distribution of fibrin within a clot as homogeneous, and therefore cannot be used directly to study the lysis of fine and coarse clots. In our model, we include a spatially heterogeneous fibrin concentration, as well as a more accurate description of the role of fibrin as a cofactor in the activation of the lytic enzyme. Our model predicts spatio-temporal protein distributions in reasonable quantitative agreement with experimental data. The model also predicts observed behaviour such as a front of lysis moving through the clot with an accumulation of lytic proteins at the front. In spite of the model improvements, however, we find that 1D continuum models are unable to accurately describe the observed differences in lysis behaviour between fine and coarse clots. Features of the problems that lead to the inaccuracy of 1D continuum models are discussed. We conclude that higher-dimensional, multiscale models are required to investigate the effect of clot structure on lysis behaviour.},

Sophisticated, multiscale models were developed to better understand the interplay of flow-mediated transport, platelet deposition, and coagulation kinetics, and their overall effect on thrombus formation. Promotion of thrombus growth is partially due to the well-known pro-coagulant roles of platelets like the surface-dependent coagulation reactions. Iterations of theoretical model predictions and experiment have helped to elucidate anticoagulant roles of platelets as well. These roles include paving over the subendothelium and hindering transport of substrates to and from enzyme complexes which can strongly affect thrombus formation. In this review, we give a brief overview of theoretical models of thrombus formation under flow and some of the experiments that motivated them and were motivated by them.},

	Abstract = {Achieving hemostasis following vascular injury requires the rapid accumulation of platelets and fibrin. Here we used a combination of confocal intravital imaging, genetically engineered mice, and antiplatelet agents to determine how variations in the extent of platelet activation following vascular injury arise from the integration of different elements of the platelet-signaling network. Two forms of penetrating injury were used to evoke the hemostatic response. Both produced a hierarchically organized structure in which a core of fully activated platelets was overlaid with an unstable shell of less-activated platelets. This structure emerged as hemostasis was achieved and persisted for at least 60 minutes following injury, its organization at least partly reflecting agonist concentration gradients. Thrombin activity and fibrin formation were found primarily in the innermost core. As proposed previously, greater packing density in the core facilitated contact-dependent signaling and limited entry of plasma-borne molecules visualized with fluorophores coupled to dextran and albumin. Blocking contact-dependent signaling or inhibiting thrombin reduced the size of the core, while the shell was heavily influenced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate and regulators of Gi2-mediated signaling. Thus, the hemostatic response is shown to produce a hierarchical structure arising, in part, from distinct elements of the platelet-signaling network.},

For an input average lumen blood velocity of 0.478 cm/s (measured by Doppler velocimetry), a 0.2 mm/s mean flow rate was obtained within the thrombus structure, most of which occurred in the 100-fold more permeable outer shell region (calculated permeability of the inner core was 10(-11) cm(2)). Average wall shear stresses were 80-100 dyne/cm(2) (peak values >200 dyne/cm(2)) on the outer rough surface of the thrombus. Within the thrombus, small molecule tracers (0.1 kDa) experienced ~70,000 collisions/s and penetrated/exited it in about 1 s, whereas proteins (~50 kDa) had ~9000 collisions/s and required about 10 s (tortuosity ~2-2.5).

	Abstract = {Blood function defines bleeding and clotting risks and dictates approaches for clinical intervention. Independent of adding exogenous tissue factor (TF), human blood treated in vitro with corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI, to block Factor XIIa) will generate thrombin after an initiation time (T(i)) of 1 to 2 hours (depending on donor), while activation of platelets with the GPVI-activator convulxin reduces T(i) to ∼20 minutes. Since current kinetic models fail to generate thrombin in the absence of added TF, we implemented a Platelet-Plasma ODE model accounting for: the Hockin-Mann protease reaction network, thrombin-dependent display of platelet phosphatidylserine, VIIa function on activated platelets, XIIa and XIa generation and function, competitive thrombin substrates (fluorogenic detector and fibrinogen), and thrombin consumption during fibrin polymerization. The kinetic model consisting of 76 ordinary differential equations (76 species, 57 reactions, 105 kinetic parameters) predicted the clotting of resting and convulxin-activated human blood as well as predicted T(i) of human blood under 50 different initial conditions that titrated increasing levels of TF, Xa, Va, XIa, IXa, and VIIa. Experiments with combined anti-XI and anti-XII antibodies prevented thrombin production, demonstrating that a leak of XIIa past saturating amounts of CTI (and not "blood-borne TF" alone) was responsible for in vitro initiation without added TF. Clotting was not blocked by antibodies used individually against TF, VII/VIIa, P-selectin, GPIb, protein disulfide isomerase, cathepsin G, nor blocked by the ribosome inhibitor puromycin, the Clk1 kinase inhibitor Tg003, or inhibited VIIa (VIIai). This is the first model to predict the observed behavior of CTI-treated human blood, either resting or stimulated with platelet activators. CTI-treated human blood will clot in vitro due to the combined activity of XIIa and XIa, a process enhanced by platelet activators and which proceeds in the absence of any evidence for kinetically significant blood borne tissue factor.},

	Abstract = {The role that mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology will play in molecular medicine and clinical development remains uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested our working hypothesis by screening a model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, developed and validated from literature. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were then compared with the treatment literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Both anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants; for example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence is reviewed supporting the prediction that fIX/FIXa activity is robust. When taken together, these results support our working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical simulation of the tissue factor pathway to the generation of thrombin has been developed using a combination of empirical, estimated, and deduced rate constants for reactions involving the activation of factor IX, X, V, and VIII, in the formation of thrombin, as well as rate constants for the assembly of the coagulation enzyme complexes which involve factor VIIIa-factor IXa (intrinsic tenase) and factor Va-Xa (prothrombinase) assembled on phospholipid membrane. Differential equations describing the fate of each species in the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of the tissue factor pathway, a physical constraint associated with the stability of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been incorporated into the model based upon the empirical observations associated with the stability of this complex. The model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through a range of initiator (factor VIIa-tissue factor) concentrations ranging from 5 pM to 5 nM. The model is responsive to alterations in the concentrations of factor VIII, factor V, and their respective activated species, factor VIIIa and factor Va, and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical data. The computer model permits the assessment of the reaction over a broad range of conditions and provides a useful tool for the development and management of reaction studies.},

	Abstract = {Tissue factor-induced blood coagulation was studied in 20 individuals, for varying periods of time during 54 months, in contact pathway-inhibited whole blood at 37 degrees C and evaluated in terms of the activation of various substrates. After quenching over time with inhibitors, the soluble phases were analyzed for thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) complex formation, prothrombin fragments, platelet activation (osteonectin release), factor Va generation, fibrinopeptide (FP) A and FPB release, and factor XIII activation. TAT complex formation, for 35 experiments, showed an initiation phase (up to 4.6 +/- 0.6 minutes) in which thrombin was generated at an average rate of 0.93 +/- 0.3 nM/min catalyzed by about 1.3 pM prothrombinase yielding approximately 26 nM thrombin. During a subsequent propagation phase, thrombin was generated at a rate of 83.9 +/- 3.8 nM/min by about 120 pM prothrombinase, reaching ultimate levels of 851 +/- 53 nM. Clot time, determined subjectively, occurred at 4.7 +/- 0.2 minutes and correlated with the inception of the propagation phase. The thrombin concentrations associated with the transitions to rapid product formation are 510 +/- 180 pM for platelet activation (1.9 +/- 0.2 minutes), 840 +/- 280 pM for factor XIII activation and factor Va generation (2.2 +/- 0.6 minutes), 1.3 +/- 0.4 nM for FPA release (2.5 +/- 0.7 minutes), 1.7 +/- 0.5 nM for FPB release and prethrombin 2 (2.8 +/- 0.8 minutes), 7.0 +/- 2.2 nM for thrombin B chain (3.6 +/- 0.2 minutes), and 26 +/- 6.2 nM for the propagation phase of TAT formation (4.6 +/- 0.6 minutes). These results illustrate that the initial activation of thrombin substrates occurs during the initiation phase at less than 2 nM thrombin (0.2%). Most thrombin (96%) is formed well after clotting occurs.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a model of the extrinsic blood coagulation system that includes the stoichiometric anticoagulants. The model accounts for the formation, expression, and propagation of the vitamin K-dependent procoagulant complexes and extends our previous model by including: (a) the tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-mediated inactivation of tissue factor (TF).VIIa and its product complexes; (b) the antithrombin-III (AT-III)-mediated inactivation of IIa, mIIa, factor VIIa, factor IXa, and factor Xa; (c) the initial activation of factor V and factor VIII by thrombin generated by factor Xa-membrane; (d) factor VIIIa dissociation/activity loss; (e) the binding competition and kinetic activation steps that exist between TF and factors VII and VIIa; and (f) the activation of factor VII by IIa, factor Xa, and factor IXa. These additions to our earlier model generate a model consisting of 34 differential equations with 42 rate constants that together describe the 27 independent equilibrium expressions, which describe the fates of 34 species. Simulations are initiated by "exposing" picomolar concentrations of TF to an electronic milieu consisting of factors II, IX, X, VII, VIIa, V, and VIIII, and the anticoagulants TFPI and AT-III at concentrations found in normal plasma or associated with coagulation pathology. The reaction followed in terms of thrombin generation, proceeds through phases that can be operationally defined as initiation, propagation, and termination. The generation of thrombin displays a nonlinear dependence upon TF, AT-III, and TFPI and the combination of these latter inhibitors displays kinetic thresholds. At subthreshold TF, thrombin production/expression is suppressed by the combination of TFPI and AT-III; for concentrations above the TF threshold, the bolus of thrombin produced is quantitatively equivalent. A comparison of the model with empirical laboratory data illustrates that most experimentally observable parameters are captured, and the pathology that results in enhanced or deficient thrombin generation is accurately described.},

	Abstract = {The ability of factor VIIa to initiate thrombin generation and clot formation in blood from healthy donors, blood from patients with hemophilia A, and in anti-factor IX antibody-induced ("acquired") hemophilia B blood was investigated. In normal blood, both factor VIIa-tissue factor (TF) complex and factor VIIa alone initiated thrombin generation. The efficiency of factor VIIa was about 0.0001 that of the factor VIIa-TF complex. In congenital hemophilia A blood and "acquired" hemophilia B blood in vitro, addition of 10 to 50 nM factor VIIa (pharmacologic concentrations) corrected the clotting time at all TF concentrations tested (0-100 pM) but had little effect on thrombin generation. Fibrinopeptide release and insoluble clot formation were only marginally influenced by addition of factor VIIa. TF alone had a more pronounced effect on thrombin generation; an increase in TF from 0 to 100 pM increased the maximum thrombin level in "acquired" hemophilia B blood from 120 to 480 nM. Platelet activation was considerably enhanced by addition of factor VIIa to both hemophilia A blood and "acquired" hemophilia B blood. Thus, pharmacologic concentrations of factor VIIa cannot restore normal thrombin generation in hemophilia A and hemophilia B blood in vitro. The efficacy of factor VIIa (10-50 nM) in hemophilia blood is dependent on TF.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The biochemistry of blood coagulation has been well defined over the past 50 years. Although much is known about the sequence of the proteolytic cascade and its regulation in the pathway to fibrin generation, many important questions remain unsolved about the mechanism of initiation and the structure of the protein complexes that form during blood coagulation.
RECENT FINDINGS: This article summarizes some of the advances that have been made in this field from the last quarter of 2002 and during 2003. The papers, which vary in rigor and content, have been selected on the basis of their interest and possible contribution to knowledge in this field. Summaries are given of new findings on the source of factor V and the synthesis of factor VIII, the mechanism of tissue factor action in the initiation of blood coagulation, the structure and membrane-binding properties of the protein complexes formed, and regulation of the blood coagulation cascade.
SUMMARY: Continued progress in this field offers opportunity for understanding the basis of thrombotic diseases and bleeding disorders, with the potential for defining novel targets for therapeutic applications. Some of the conclusions reviewed are conflicting, and further work will be necessary to place the results in the context of what has already been established. The structural biology of the coagulation proteins and understanding of hemostasis and thrombosis in a physiologic context have important implications for future work.},

	Abstract = {The process of tissue factor initiated blood coagulation is discussed. Reactions of the blood coagulation cascade are propagated by complex enzymes containing a vitamin K-dependent serine protease and an accessory cofactor protein that are assembled on a membrane surface in a calcium-dependent manner. These complexes are 105-109-fold more efficient in proteolyses of their natural substrates than enzymes alone. Based upon data acquired using several in vitro models of blood coagulation, tissue factor initiated thrombin generation can be divided into two phases: an initiation phase and a propagation phase. The initiation phase is characterized by the generation of nanomolar amounts of thrombin, femto- to picomolar amounts of factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, and XIa, partial activation of platelets, and almost quantitative activation of procofactors, factors V and VIII. The duration of this phase is primarily influenced by concentrations of tissue factor and TFPI. The characteristic features of the propagation phase are: almost quantitative prothrombin activation at a high rate, completion of platelet activation, and solid clot formation. This phase is primarily regulated by antithrombin III and the protein C system. Thrombin generation during the propagation phase is remarkably suppressed in the absence of factor VIII and IX (hemophilia A and B, respectively) and at platelet counts <5% of mean plasma concentration. The majority of data accumulated in in vitro models and discussed in this review are in good agreement with the results of in vivo observations.},

@article{Adams:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Coagulation involves the regulated sequence of proteolytic activation of a series of zymogens to achieve appropriate and timely haemostasis in an injured vessel, in an environment that overwhelmingly favours an anticoagulant state. In the non-pathological state, the inciting event involves exposure of circulating factor VII/VIIa to extravascularly expressed tissue factor, which brings into motion the series of steps which results in amplification of the initial stimulus, culminating in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and clot formation. The precisely synchronized cascade of events is counter-balanced by a system of anticoagulant mechanisms, which serve to ensure that the haemostatic effect is regulated and does not extend inappropriately. Conversely, in pathological states, these events can escape normal control mechanisms, due to either inherited or acquired defects, which lead to thrombosis. Current anticoagulant therapy, although based on medications that have been in existence for upwards of 80 years, is moving towards targeted therapy for specific coagulation factors and events in the coagulation cascade, based on the current knowledge of the main triggers and key events within the series of reactions that culminates in haemostasis. It remains to be seen whether these newer medications will become first-line therapies for thrombosis in the coming decade. This review aims to elucidate the main events within the coagulation cascade as it is currently understood to operate in vivo, with a brief discussion focusing on hypercoagulable states, and also a short review of the history of anticoagulants as they relate to this model.},

	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

@article{Cirit:2012kx,
	Abstract = {Signal transduction networks in mammalian cells, comprising a limited set of interacting biochemical pathways, are accessed by various growth factor and cytokine receptors to elicit distinct cell responses. This raises the question as to how specificity of the stimulus-response relationship is encoded at the molecular level. It has been proposed that specificity arises not only from the activation of unique signalling pathways, but also from quantitative differences in the activation and regulation of shared receptor-proximal signalling proteins. To address such hypotheses, data sets with greater precision and coverage of experimental conditions will need to be acquired, and rigorous frameworks that codify and parameterize the inherently non-linear relationships among signalling activities will need to be developed. In the present study we apply a systematic approach combining quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling to compare the signalling networks accessed by FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptors in mouse fibroblasts, in which the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) cascade is activated by Ras- and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent pathways. We show that, whereas the FGF stimulation of PI3K signalling is relatively weak, this deficiency is compensated for by a more potent Ras-dependent activation of ERK. Thus, as the modelling would predict, the ERK pathway is activated to a greater extent in cells co-stimulated with FGF and PDGF, relative to the saturated levels achieved with either ligand alone. It is envisaged that similar approaches will prove valuable in the elucidation of quantitative differences among other closely related receptor signalling networks.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated the influence of alterations in plasma coagulation factor levels between 50% and 150% of their mean values for prothrombin, factor X, factor XI, factor IX, factor VII, factor VIII, factor V, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT-III), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as well as combinations of extremes, eg, 50% anticoagulants and 150% procoagulants or 50% procoagulants and 150% anticoagulants in a synthetic "plasma" system. The reaction systems were constructed in vitro using purified, natural, and recombinant proteins and synthetic phospholipid vesicles or platelets with the reactions initiated by recombinant tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa complex (5 pmol/L). To investigate the influence of the protein C system, soluble thrombomodulin (Tm) was also added to the reaction mixture. For the most extreme situations in which the essential plasma procoagulants (prothrombin, and factors X, IX, V, and VIII) and the stoichiometric anticoagulants (AT-III and TFPI) were collectively and inversely altered by 50%, a 28-fold difference in the total available thrombin generated was observed. Variations of most of these proteins 50% above and below the "normal" range, with the remainder at 100%, had only modest influences on the peak and total levels of thrombin generated. The dominant factors influencing thrombin generation were prothrombin and AT-III. When these 2 components were held at 100% and all other plasma procoagulants were reduced to 50%, there was a 60% reduction in the available thrombin generated. No increase in the thrombin generated was observed when the 150% level of all plasma procoagulants other than prothrombin was evaluated. When only prothrombin was raised to 150%, and all other factors were maintained at 100%, the thrombin generated increased by 71% to 121%. When AT-III was at 50% and all other constituents were at 100%, thrombin production was increased by 104% to 196%. The additions of protein C and protein S over the 50% to 150% ranges with Tm at 0.1 nmol/L concentration had limited influence on thrombin generation. Individual variations in factors VII, XI, and X concentrations had little effect on the duration of the initiation phase, the peak thrombin level achieved, or the available thrombin generated. Paradoxically, increases in factor IX concentration to 150% led to lowered thrombin generation, while decreases to 50% led to enhanced thrombin generation, most likely a consequence of factor IX as a competitive substrate with factor X for factor VIIa-TF. Reductions in factor V or factor VIII concentration led to prolongations of the initiation phase, while the reduction of TFPI to 50% led to shortening of this phase. However, none of these alterations led to significant changes in the available thrombin generated. Based on these data, one might surmise that increases in prothrombin and reductions in AT-III, within the normal range, would be potential risk factors for thrombosis and that algorithms that combine normal factor levels may be required to develop predictive tests for thrombosis.},

	Abstract = {The protein p53 functions as a tumor suppressor and can trigger either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We used Boolean network modeling and attractor landscape analysis to analyze the state transition dynamics of a simplified p53 network for which particular combinations of activation states of the molecules corresponded to specific cellular outcomes. Our results identified five critical interactions in the network that determined the cellular response to DNA damage, and simulations lacking any of these interactions produced states associated with sustained p53 activity, which corresponded to a cell death response. Attractor landscape analysis of the cellular response to DNA damage of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the effect of the Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) inhibitor nutlin-3 indicated that nutlin-3 would exhibit limited efficacy in triggering cell death, because the cell death state was not induced to a large extent by simulations with nutlin-3 and instead produced a state consistent with oscillatory p53 dynamics and cell cycle arrest. Attractor landscape analysis also suggested that combining nutlin-3 with inhibition of Wip1 would synergize to stimulate a sustained increase in p53 activity and promote p53-mediated cell death. We validated this synergistic effect in stimulating p53 activity and triggering cell death with single-cell imaging of a fluorescent p53 reporter in MCF7 cells. Thus, attractor landscape analysis of p53 network dynamics and its regulation can identify potential therapeutic strategies for treating cancer.},

	Abstract = {Cells employ highly dynamic signaling networks to drive biological decision processes. Perturbations to these signaling networks may attract cells to new malignant signaling and phenotypic states, termed cancer network attractors, that result in cancer development. As different cancer cells reach these malignant states by accumulating different molecular alterations, uncovering these mechanisms represents a grand challenge in cancer biology. Addressing this challenge will require new systems-based strategies that capture the intrinsic properties of cancer signaling networks and provide deeper understanding of the processes by which genetic lesions perturb these networks and lead to disease phenotypes. Network biology will help circumvent fundamental obstacles in cancer treatment, such as drug resistance and metastasis, empowering personalized and tumor-specific cancer therapies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a "typical cell". However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.
RESULTS: In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.},

@article{2011_kalita_brasier_JBC,
	Abstract = {The canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway controls a gene network important in the cellular inflammatory response. Upon activation, NF-κB/RelA is released from cytoplasmic inhibitors, from where it translocates into the nucleus, subsequently activating negative feedback loops producing either monophasic or damped oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics. Although the population behavior of the NF-κB pathway has been extensively modeled, the sources of cell-to-cell variability are not well understood. We describe an integrated experimental-computational analysis of NF-κB/RelA translocation in a validated cell model exhibiting monophasic dynamics. Quantitative measures of cellular geometry and total cytoplasmic concentration and translocated RelA amounts were used as priors in Bayesian inference to estimate biophysically realistic parameter values based on dynamic live cell imaging studies of enhanced GFP-tagged RelA in stable transfectants. Bayesian inference was performed on multiple cells simultaneously, assuming identical reaction rate parameters, whereas cellular geometry and initial and total NF-κB concentration-related parameters were cell-specific. A subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct kinetic profiles was identified that corresponded to differences in the IκBα translation rate. We conclude that cellular geometry, initial and total NF-κB concentration, IκBα translation, and IκBα degradation rates account for distinct cell-to-cell differences in canonical NF-κB translocation dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The role of mechanistic modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether uncertain models could be used to understand how a network responds to a therapeutic intervention. As a proof of concept, we modeled and analyzed the response of the human coagulation cascade to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and prothrombin (fII) addition in normal and hemophilic plasma. An ensemble of parametrically uncertain human coagulation models was developed (N = 437). Each model described the time evolution of 193 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 301 interactions under quiescent flow. The 467 unknown model parameters were estimated, using multiobjective optimization, from published in vitro coagulation studies. The model ensemble was validated using published in vitro thrombin measurements and thrombin measurements taken from coronary artery disease patients. Sensitivity analysis was then used to rank-order the importance of model parameters as a function of experimental or physiological conditions. A novel strategy for the systematic comparison of ranks identified a family of fX/FXa and fII/FIIa interactions that became more sensitive with decreasing fVIII/fIX. The fragility of these interactions was preserved following the addition of exogenous rFVIIa and fII. This suggested that exogenous rFVIIa did not alter the qualitative operation of the cascade. Rather, exogenous rFVIIa and fII took advantage of existing fluid and interfacial fX/FXa and fII/FIIa sensitivity to restore normal coagulation in low fVIII/fIX conditions. The proposed rFVIIa mechanism of action was consistent with experimental literature not used in model training. Thus, we demonstrated that an ensemble of uncertain models could unravel key facets of the mechanism of action of a focused intervention. Whereas the current study was limited to coagulation, perhaps the general strategy used could be extended to other molecular networks relevant to human health.},

@article{2010_song_varner_BiotechJ,
	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},

	Abstract = {Computational models are increasingly used to understand and predict complex biological phenomena. These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated understanding of the system. However, development of useful models from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed. Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

Three recent trials investigating on-demand treatment (Kavakli et al 2006, Santagostino et al 2006, and Young et al 2008) lend further weight to earlier reports demonstrating that a single dose of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa is as effective as a repeat-dose schedule of 3 x 90 microg/kg rFVIIa in producing hemostasis, reducing the need for additional hemostatic medications, and improving pain and mobility in joints affected by hemarthroses. The single-dose regimen is advantageous as it may reduce both the difficulties caused by the need for repeated venous access and the interruption of daily activities associated with repeat dosing. Safety data from these three trials, along with those from a fourth study investigating the prophylactic use of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa, also demonstrate no additional or altered safety profile associated with single-dose treatment. These findings suggest that a single dose of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa is as safe and effective a hemostatic regimen as the standard lower, more frequent dose regimen and provides comparable bleeding control in hemophilia patients with inhibitors.

Analysis of pediatric data from various studies and case reports indicates that rFVIIa is safe and effective for the control of spontaneous or surgical bleeding in hemophilic children with inhibitors, including central nervous system bleeds, and bleeding episodes during immune tolerance induction therapy. The very young pediatric population (less than 1 year of age) poses specific difficulties in treatment, and rFVIIa provides an effective alternative to other therapeutic modalities. In some hemophilia B patients with inhibitors, anaphylactic reaction to FIX infusions is a potentially life-threatening problem, for which rFVIIa may provide the only safe alternative therapy for the control of bleeding episodes.

	Abstract = {Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa: NovoSeven; Novo Nordisk) has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemophilic patients with inhibitors. This prospective, double-blind study compared rFVIIa (35 vs. 90 microg/kg) in the initiation and maintenance of haemostasis during and after elective surgery. Patients with inhibitors (FVIII, n = 26; FIX, n = 3) received rFVIIa immediately prior to incision; intraoperatively as needed; every 2 h for the first 48 h; and every 2-6 h for the following 3 days. Haemostasis was evaluated during surgery, at 0, 8, 24 and 48 h and 3, 4 and 5 days after wound closure. After day 5, open-label rFVIIa (90 microg/kg) was available for maintenance. Intraoperative haemostasis was achieved in 28/29 patients. All high-dose patients and 12/15 low dose patients had satisfactory haemostasis during the first 48 h. Twenty-three patients (13/14 high dose) successfully completed the study. Although the 35 microg/kg dose is probably sub-optimal for post-operative management, at least in major procedures, rFVIIa 90 microg/kg is an effective first-line option in surgery for patients with inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was developed to provide an improved procoagulant component capable of 'by-passing' inhibitor antibodies in the treatment of haemophilic patients. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two dosage regimens of rFVIIa (given intravenously at periodic intervals) in the treatment of joint, muscle and mucocutaneous haemorrhages in persons with haemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, international multicenter trial. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment A: 35 mu kg-1 or B: 70 mu kg-1, in blocks of 2. Within each block, one patient was assigned to the 35 mu kg-1 dosing regimen and the other to 70 mu kg-1 dose. One hundred and fifty subjects from 20 sites were screened for this study and 116 had baseline assessments. Of these, 84 were treated on the protocol and 32 were not treated in the study, in most cases because they did not return to the clinic with an eligible bleeding episode. One hundred and seventy-nine bleeding episodes were treated, of which 145 (81%) were acute haemarthroses. Both treatments were efficacious, with 71% having an excellent (59% and 60%) or effective (12% and 11%) response. Overall, the mean and median number of doses given per episode of joint bleeding were 3.1 and 2, respectively. The mean number of doses was 3.1 for the 70 mu kg-1 group and 2.7 for the 35 mu kg-1 group (P value = 0.142). The study concluded that rFVIIa in a dosage of 35 mu kg-1 or 70 mu kg-1 is both safe and reasonably effective in the treatment of joint or muscle haemorrhages in haemophilic patients with inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII or factor IX. It is concluded that the appropriate dose for the treatment of joint and peripheral muscle bleeding in haemophilic patients with inhibitors is 35-70 mu kg-1 given at 2-3 h intervals until haemostasis is achieved.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa) was developed for treatment of haemophilia patients with inhibitors against FVIII/FIX. The haemostatic efficacy rate of 80-90% including major orthopaedic surgery (dosing of 90-120 microg/kg every other hour [h] for at least the first 24 h) was achieved in these patients. In a home-treatment setting the efficacy rate of haemostasis in mild-moderate bleedings was 92% (average number of 90 microg/kg doses was 2.2). A wide individual variation regarding recovery of rFVIIa (46 +/- 12%; median 43%) as well as of clearance rate (36 +/- 8 ml/kg/h; median 32 ml/kg/h in adults; children 2-3 times higher) has been observed. Thus children may require higher doses than adults. Accordingly the use of a dose of 270 microg/kg in one single injection was approved in the EU. Recent experience indicates that repeated doses of rFVIIa may decrease the number of bleeds in "target joints", and thus may be useful as prophylaxis in severe hemophilia with inhibitors. Pharmacological concentrations of rFVIIa have been shown to enhance the thrombin generation on thrombin activated platelets in a cell-based model. By doing so a tight structured fibrin haemostatic plug resistant against premature lysis is formed. rFVIIa has been shown to induce haemostasis not only in haemophilia but also in other situations characterized by an impaired thrombin generation such as platelet defects, dilution coagulopathy developed as a result of trauma and extensive surgery. A special form of profuse bleeding, that may cause extensive problems is postpartum haemorrhage.},

@article{Tanaka:2009wo,
	Abstract = {Perioperative bleeding is a major challenge particularly because of increasing clinical use of potent antithrombotic drugs. Understanding current concepts of coagulation is important in determining the preoperative bleeding risk of patients, and in managing hemostatic therapy perioperatively. The serine protease thrombin plays pivotal roles in the activation of additional serine protease zymogens (inactive enzymatic precursors), cofactors, and cell-surface receptors. Thrombin generation is closely regulated to locally achieve rapid hemostasis after injury without causing uncontrolled systemic thrombosis. During surgery, there are major disturbances in coagulation and inflammatory systems because of hemorrhage/hemodilution, blood transfusion, and surgical stresses. Postoperative bleeding often requires allogeneic blood transfusions, which support thrombin generation and hemostasis. However, procoagulant activity and inflammation are increased postoperatively; thus, antithrombotic therapy may be required to prevent perioperative thrombotic complications. There have been significant advances in the management of perioperative hemostasis and thrombosis because of the introduction of novel hemostatic and antithrombotic drugs. However, a limitation of current treatment is that conventional clotting tests do not reflect the entire physiological processes of coagulation making optimal pharmacologic therapy difficult. Understanding the in vivo regulatory mechanisms and pharmacologic modulation of thrombin generation may help control bleeding without potentially increasing prothrombotic risks. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of hemostasis and thrombin generation using multiple, simplified models of coagulation.},
