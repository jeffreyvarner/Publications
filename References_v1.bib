@article{Thalmann1994,
	Abstract = {Our laboratory has previously reported on the derivation of LNCaP cell sublines from LNCaP tumors maintained in castrated and intact athymic male mice. These LNCaP sublines differ from the parental line in tumorigenicity and androgen dependence. This paper demonstrates that one of these sublines acquired metastatic potential. When inoculated either s.c. or orthotopically, the C4-2 subline metastasized to the lymph node and bone with an incidence of 11-50%. Interestingly, the incidence of osseous metastasis was higher in castrated than in intact male hosts. We evaluated the chromosomal, immunohistochemical, and biochemical characteristics of the LNCaP sublines derived from C4-2 tumors that metastasized to the lymph node and bone. Cytogenetic analysis showed that all sublines were human and shared common marker chromosomes with the parental LNCaP cells. This experimental human prostate cancer model may permit, for the first time, the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying human prostate cancer metastasis.},

@article{Matsumoto2013,
	Abstract = {Androgens play pivotal roles in the regulation of male development and physiological processes, particularly in the male reproductive system. Most biological effects of androgens are mediated by the action of nuclear androgen receptor (AR). AR acts as a master regulator of downstream androgen-dependent signaling pathway networks. This ligand-dependent transcriptional factor modulates gene expression through the recruitment of various coregulator complexes, the induction of chromatin reorganization, and epigenetic histone modifications at target genomic loci. Dysregulation of androgen/AR signaling perturbs normal reproductive development and accounts for a wide range of pathological conditions such as androgen-insensitive syndrome, prostate cancer, and spinal bulbar muscular atrophy. In this review we summarize recent advances in understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms of AR action as well as newly recognized aspects of AR-mediated androgen signaling in both men and women. In addition, we offer a perspective on the use of animal genetic model systems aimed at eventually developing novel therapeutic AR ligands.},

	Abstract = {Aberrant signaling by the androgen receptor contributes to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. The involvement of molecular chaperones in the processes of folding, activation, trafficking, and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor provide different points along the signaling axis where regulation of androgen receptor activity can be hijacked to provide growth signals for clonal selection in cancer progression. Evidence exists of abnormal chaperone expression that could contribute to the upregulation of AR activity in prostate tumors. Regardless of whether chaperones are involved in the causation of prostate carcinogenesis, molecular chaperones provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.},

@article{Grad1999,
	Abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) gene is transcriptionally regulated by AR (autoregulation); however, the androgen response elements (AREs) required for this process have not been found in the AR promoter or in the 5'-flanking region. We previously showed that the AR cDNA contains AREs involved in AR mRNA autoregulation and that auto(up)regulation is reproduced in PC3 cells (a human prostate cancer cell line) expressing the human AR cDNA driven by a heterologous promoter. A 350-bp fragment of the AR cDNA contains the requisite AREs (ARE-1 and ARE-2) and, when linked upstream of a reporter gene, confers androgen inducibility in a cell-specific manner. Here we report that, although an AR cDNA harboring silent mutations of ARE-1 and ARE-2 produces a transcriptionally active AR, AR mRNA encoded by this mutant cDNA is not up-regulated in androgen-treated PC3 cells. Thus, ARE-1 and ARE-2 are essential for androgen-mediated up-regulation of AR mRNA in this model. Since ARE-1 and ARE-2 are located on separate exons (exons D and E) in the AR gene, we evaluated these AREs in their native context, a 6.5-kb AR genomic fragment. Androgen regulated the 6.5-kb AR genomic fragment and the 350-bp region of the AR cDNA at comparable levels, suggesting that sequences in exons D and E are likely to be involved in androgen-mediated up-regulation of the native AR gene. Furthermore, androgen regulated both responsive regions in U2OS cells, a human osteoblastic cell line that exhibits androgen-mediated up-regulation of native AR mRNA. DNAse I footprinting of the 350-bp region with recombinant AR (DNA- and ligand-binding domains) suggested the presence of additional AREs. Gel shift analyses and mutational studies showed that maximal androgen regulation and AR binding were dependent on the integrity of four AREs (ARE-1, ARE-1A, IVSARE, and ARE-2). While the presence of multiple, nonconsensus AREs is common among other androgen-regulated enhancers, the androgen-responsive region of the AR gene is unique because it contains exonic AREs. DNA binding studies with nuclear extracts were performed to determine whether non-AR transcription factors contribute to androgen regulation of the 350-bp region. These studies, in conjunction with mutational analysis and reporter gene assays with dominant negative Myc and Max expression vectors, showed that Myc and Max interaction with a Myc consensus site is required for androgen regulation of the 350-bp fragment. These results represent a novel interaction between AR and the Myc family of proteins and support a model of androgenic control of AR mRNA via AR and Myc family interaction with a unique internal androgen-responsive region harboring multiple exonic regulatory sequences.},

@article{Whang2013,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2 tyrosine kinases may be involved in activation of androgen receptor and progression of prostate cancer. They represent potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. Lapatinib is an oral inhibitor of EGFR and HER-2. The objective of this study is to assess the preliminary clinical efficacy of lapatinib in the therapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer.
METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label trial, patients with rising PSA on androgen deprivation therapy and not having received chemotherapy were eligible. They were treated with lapatinib at a dose of 1,500 mg once daily. The primary end point was a >50% confirmed PSA decline from baseline; safety, tolerability, and time to PSA progression were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients enrolled in the study had a median age of 73 years and a baseline PSA of 21.6 ng/ml. Seven patients had no radiologic evidence of metastatic disease, while the remaining patients had bone or measurable disease or both. Treatment was well tolerated with only grade 3 treatment-related toxicities being diarrhea (14%) and rash (3%). One of 21 evaluable patients had >50% reduction in PSA, while another patient had 47% reduction in PSA with an ongoing duration of response of 45+ months. The median time to PSA progression was 29 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Lapatinib showed single agent activity in a small subset of unselected patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, as measured by PSA. Future trials should explore a trial design with time-to-event end points and predictive biomarkers and a combination with other agents.},

@article{Lee2004,
	Abstract = {The involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in steroid-induced cell proliferation has received much attention. However, the adaptor molecule that mediates this interaction remains to be identified. In this communication, we identify p52(Shc) as the mediator between tyrosine phosphorylation signaling and steroid signaling in steroid-responsive cell proliferation. Although the different LNCaP prostate cancer cells, C-33, C-51 and C-81, express similar levels of functional androgen receptor (AR), they exhibit different levels of androgen sensitivity. C-33 cell proliferation is highly responsive to the presence of androgens, whereas C-51 cell proliferation is comparatively less responsive to androgens. In contrast, C-81 cell proliferation is independent of androgens. In these cells, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of both p52(Shc) and ErbB-2 were greatest in C-81 cells, comparatively less in C-51 cells and weaker in C-33 cells. The levels and activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase, cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, decreased correspondingly in those cells. In both androgen-independent, rapidly growing C-81 and ErbB-2 cDNA-transfected C-33 cells, p52(Shc) was hyperphosphorylated at Tyr317 (Y317). Conversely, p52(Shc) tyrophosphorylation was decreased in prostatic acid phosphatase cDNA-transfected stable subclones of C-81 cells, which restore androgen-sensitive proliferation and leads to slow growth rates. In C-33 cells, androgen-stimulated cell proliferation correlated with tyrophosphorylation of ErbB-2 and increased phosphorylation of p52(Shc) at Y317, but not at Y239, differing from phosphorylation patterns associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutant of p52(Shc), that is Y317F, blocks Y317 phosphorylation of endogenous p52(Shc) and abolishes androgen-stimulated proliferation, but not EGF-stimulated proliferation. Thus, Y317 of p52(Shc) serves as an important regulatory site that allows tyrosine phosphorylation pathways to moderate androgen sensitivity in human prostate cancer cells.},

	Abstract = {Here we address the problem of parameter estimation (inverse problem) of nonlinear dynamic biochemical pathways. This problem is stated as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem subject to nonlinear differential-algebraic constraints. These problems are known to be frequently ill-conditioned and multimodal. Thus, traditional (gradient-based) local optimization methods fail to arrive at satisfactory solutions. To surmount this limitation, the use of several state-of-the-art deterministic and stochastic global optimization methods is explored. A case study considering the estimation of 36 parameters of a nonlinear biochemical dynamic model is taken as a benchmark. Only a certain type of stochastic algorithm, evolution strategies (ES), is able to solve this problem successfully. Although these stochastic methods cannot guarantee global optimality with certainty, their robustness, plus the fact that in inverse problems they have a known lower bound for the cost function, make them the best available candidates.},

@article{Pratt:1997kx,
	Abstract = {We have provided a historical perspective on a body of steroid receptor research dealing with the structure and physiological significance of the untransformed 9S receptor that has often confused both novice and expert investigators. The frequent controversies and equivocations of earlier studies were due to the fact that the native, hormone-free state of these receptors is a large multiprotein complex that resisted description for many years because of its unstable and dynamic nature. The untransformed 9S state of the steroid and dioxin receptors has provided a unique system for studying the function of the ubiquitous, abundant, and conserved heat shock protein, hsp90. The hormonal control of receptor association with hsp90 provided a method of manipulating the receptor heterocomplex in a manner that was physiologically meaningful. For several steroid receptors, binding to hsp90 was required for the receptor to be in a native hormone-binding state, and for all of the receptors, hormone binding promoted dissociation of the receptor from hsp90 and conversion of the receptor to the DNA-binding state. Although the complexes between tyrosine kinases and hsp90 were discovered earlier, the hormonal regulation or steroid receptor association with hsp90 permitted much more rapid and facile study of hsp90 function. The observations that hsp90 binds to the receptors through their HBDs and that these domains can be fused to structurally different proteins bringing their function under hormonal control provided a powerful linkage between the hormonal regulation of receptor binding to hsp90 and the initial step in steroid hormone action. Because the 9S receptor hsp90 heterocomplexes could be physically stabilized by molybdate, their protein composition could be readily studied, and it became clear that these complexes are multiprotein structures containing a number of unique proteins, such as FKBP51, FKBP52, CyP-40, and p23, that were discovered because of their presence in these structures. Further analysis showed that hsp90 itself exists in a variety of native multiprotein heterocomplexes independent of steroid receptors and other 'substrate' proteins. Cell-free systems can now be used to study the formation of receptor heterocomplexes. As we outlined in the scheme of Fig. 1, the multicomponent receptor-hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system is being reconstituted, and the importance of individual proteins, such as hsp70, p60, and p23, in the assembly process is becoming recognized. It should be noted that our understanding of the mechanism and purpose of steroid receptor heterocomplex assembly is still at an early stage. We can now speculate on the roles of receptor-associated proteins in receptor action, both as individuals and as a group, but their actual functions are still vague or unknown. We can make realistic models about the chaperoning and trafficking of steroid receptors, but we don't yet know how these processes occur, we don't know where chaperoning occurs in the cell (e.g. Is it limited to the cytoplasm? Is it a diffuse process or does chaperoning occur in association with structural elements?), and, with the exception of the requirement for hormone binding, we don't know the extent to which the hsp90-based chaperone system impacts on steroid hormone action. It is not yet clear how far the discovery of this hsp90 heterocomplex assembly system will be extended to the development of a general understanding of protein processing in the cell. Because this assembly system is apparently present in all eukaryotic cells, it probably performs an essential function for many proteins.

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium dynamics are critical to cellular functions like pain transmission. Extracellular ATP plays an important role in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with the P2 family of surface receptors. In this study, we developed a mechanistic mathematical model of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling in archetype sensory neurons. The model architecture, which described 90 species connected by 162 interactions, was formulated by aggregating disparate molecular modules from literature. Unlike previous models, only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants. Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters. Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter sets using a multi-objective thermal ensemble method. Each member of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near the optimal trade-off surface between the individual training data sets. The model quantitatively reproduced experimental measurements from dorsal root ganglion neurons as a function of extracellular ATP forcing. Hypothesized architecture linking phosphoinositide regulation with P2X receptor activity explained the inhibition of P2X-mediated current flow by activated metabotropic P2Y receptors. Sensitivity analysis using individual and the whole system outputs suggested which molecular subsystems were most important following P2 activation. Taken together, modeling and analysis of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling generated qualitative insight into the critical interactions controlling ATP induced calcium dynamics. Understanding these critical interactions may prove useful for the design of the next generation of molecular pain management strategies.},

	Abstract = {Insulin, the primary hormone regulating the level of glucose in the bloodstream, modulates a variety of cellular and enzymatic processes in normal and diseased cells. Insulin signals are processed by a complex network of biochemical interactions which ultimately induce gene expression programs or other processes such as translation initiation. Surprisingly, despite the wealth of literature on insulin signaling, the relative importance of the components linking insulin with translation initiation remains unclear. We addressed this question by developing and interrogating a family of mathematical models of insulin induced translation initiation. The insulin network was modeled using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework. A family of model parameters was estimated, starting from an initial best fit parameter set, using 24 experimental data sets taken from literature. The residual between model simulations and each of the experimental constraints were simultaneously minimized using multiobjective optimization. Interrogation of the model population, using sensitivity and robustness analysis, identified an insulin-dependent switch that controlled translation initiation. Our analysis suggested that without insulin, a balance between the pro-initiation activity of the GTP-binding protein Rheb and anti-initiation activity of PTEN controlled basal initiation. On the other hand, in the presence of insulin a combination of PI3K and Rheb activity controlled inducible initiation, where PI3K was only critical in the presence of insulin. Other well known regulatory mechanisms governing insulin action, for example IRS-1 negative feedback, modulated the relative importance of PI3K and Rheb but did not fundamentally change the signal flow.},

	Abstract = {The biological action of androgens is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR). Androgen-bound AR functions as a transcription factor to regulate genes involved in an array of physiological processes, most notably male sexual differentiation and maturation, and the maintenance of spermatogenesis. The transcriptional activity of AR is affected by coregulators that influence a number of functional properties of AR, including ligand selectivity and DNA binding capacity. As the promoter of target genes, coregulators participate in DNA modification, either directly through modification of histones or indirectly by the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes, as well as functioning in the recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery. Aberrant coregulator activity due to mutation or altered expression levels may be a contributing factor in the progression of diseases related to AR activity, such as prostate cancer. AR demonstrates distinct differences in its interaction with coregulators from other steroid receptors due to differences in the functional interaction between AR domains, possibly resulting in alterations in the dynamic interactions between coregulator complexes.},

We assessed the efficacy and safety of radium-223 as compared with placebo, in addition to the best standard of care, in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases.
METHODS: In our phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 921 patients who had received, were not eligible to receive, or declined docetaxel, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive six injections of radium-223 (at a dose of 50 kBq per kilogram of body weight intravenously) or matching placebo; one injection was administered every 4 weeks. In addition, all patients received the best standard of care. The primary end point was overall survival. The main secondary efficacy end points included time to the first symptomatic skeletal event and various biochemical end points. A prespecified interim analysis, conducted when 314 deaths had occurred, assessed the effect of radium-223 versus placebo on survival. An updated analysis, when 528 deaths had occurred, was performed before crossover from placebo to radium-223.
RESULTS: At the interim analysis, which involved 809 patients, radium-223, as compared with placebo, significantly improved overall survival (median, 14.0 months vs. 11.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.88; two-sided P=0.002). The updated analysis involving 921 patients confirmed the radium-223 survival benefit (median, 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; P<0.001). Assessments of all main secondary efficacy end points also showed a benefit of radium-233 as compared with placebo. Radium-223 was associated with low myelosuppression rates and fewer adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, which was terminated for efficacy at the prespecified interim analysis, radium-223 improved overall survival. (Funded by Algeta and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals; ALSYMPCA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00699751.).},

	Abstract = {Prostate cancer is characterized by its dependence on androgen receptor (AR) and frequent activation of PI3K signaling. We find that AR transcriptional output is decreased in human and murine tumors with PTEN deletion and that PI3K pathway inhibition activates AR signaling by relieving feedback inhibition of HER kinases. Similarly, AR inhibition activates AKT signaling by reducing levels of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP. Thus, these two oncogenic pathways cross-regulate each other by reciprocal feedback. Inhibition of one activates the other, thereby maintaining tumor cell survival. However, combined pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and AR signaling caused near-complete prostate cancer regressions in a Pten-deficient murine prostate cancer model and in human prostate cancer xenografts, indicating that both pathways coordinately support survival.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cabazitaxel is a novel tubulin-binding taxane drug with antitumour activity in docetaxel-resistant cancers. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel plus prednisone with those of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with progressive disease after docetaxel-based treatment.
METHODS: We undertook an open-label randomised phase 3 trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had received previous hormone therapy, but whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with a docetaxel-containing regimen. Participants were treated with 10 mg oral prednisone daily, and were randomly assigned to receive either 12 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone intravenously over 15-30 min or 25 mg/m(2) cabazitaxel intravenously over 1 h every 3 weeks. The random allocation schedule was computer-generated; patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but the study team was masked to the data analysis. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00417079.
FINDINGS: 755 men were allocated to treatment groups (377 mitoxantrone, 378 cabazitaxel) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At the cutoff for the final analysis (Sept 25, 2009), median survival was 15·1 months (95% CI 14·1-16·3) in the cabazitaxel group and 12·7 months (11·6-13·7) in the mitoxantrone group. The hazard ratio for death of men treated with cabazitaxel compared with those taking mitoxantrone was 0·70 (95% CI 0·59-0·83, p<0·0001). Median progression-free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·4-3·0) in the cabazitaxel group and 1·4 months (1·4-1·7) in the mitoxantrone group (HR 0·74, 0·64-0·86, p<0·0001). The most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (cabazitaxel, 303 [82%] patients vs mitoxantrone, 215 [58%]) and diarrhoea (23 [6%] vs one [<1%]). 28 (8%) patients in the cabazitaxel group and five (1%) in the mitoxantrone group had febrile neutropenia.
INTERPRETATION: Treatment with cabazitaxel plus prednisone has important clinical antitumour activity, improving overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progressed during or after docetaxel-based therapy.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sipuleucel-T, an autologous active cellular immunotherapy, has shown evidence of efficacy in reducing the risk of death among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 512 patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive either sipuleucel-T (341 patients) or placebo (171 patients) administered intravenously every 2 weeks, for a total of three infusions. The primary end point was overall survival, analyzed by means of a stratified Cox regression model adjusted for baseline levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and lactate dehydrogenase.
RESULTS: In the sipuleucel-T group, there was a relative reduction of 22% in the risk of death as compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 0.98; P=0.03). This reduction represented a 4.1-month improvement in median survival (25.8 months in the sipuleucel-T group vs. 21.7 months in the placebo group). The 36-month survival probability was 31.7% in the sipuleucel-T group versus 23.0% in the placebo group. The treatment effect was also observed with the use of an unadjusted Cox model and a log-rank test (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.97; P=0.02) and after adjustment for use of docetaxel after the study therapy (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.98; P=0.03). The time to objective disease progression was similar in the two study groups. Immune responses to the immunizing antigen were observed in patients who received sipuleucel-T. Adverse events that were more frequently reported in the sipuleucel-T group than in the placebo group included chills, fever, and headache.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of sipuleucel-T prolonged overall survival among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. No effect on the time to disease progression was observed. (Funded by Dendreon; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00065442.)},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to ligand binding, but the functional consequences and mechanisms regulating AR phosphorylation remain to be established. We observed initially that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of the major PPP family serine/threonine phosphatases PP2A and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), had cell type-dependent effects on AR expression. More specific inhibitors of PP2A (fostriecin) and PP1 (tautomycin and siRNA against the PP1alpha catalytic subunit) demonstrated that PP1 and protein phosphatase 2A had opposite effects on AR protein and transcriptional activity. PP1 inhibition enhanced proteasome-mediated AR degradation, while PP1alpha overexpression increased AR expression and markedly enhanced AR transcriptional activity. Coprecipitation experiments demonstrated an AR-PP1 interaction, while immunofluorescence and nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation showed androgen-stimulated nuclear translocation of both AR and PP1 in prostate cancer cells. Studies with phosphospecific AR antibodies showed that PP1 inhibition dramatically increased phosphorylation of Ser-650, a site in the AR hinge region shown to mediate nuclear export. Significantly, PP1 inhibition caused a marked decrease in nuclear localization of the wild-type AR, but did not alter total or nuclear levels of a S650A mutant AR. These findings reveal a critical role of PP1 in regulating AR protein stability and nuclear localization through dephosphorylation of Ser-650. Moreover, AR may function as a PP1 regulatory subunit and mediate PP1 recruitment to chromatin, where it can modulate transcription and splicing.},

	Abstract = {Androgen signaling plays an important role in many biological processes. Androgen Responsive Gene Database (ARGDB) is devoted to providing integrated knowledge on androgen-controlled genes. Gene records were collected on the basis of PubMed literature collections. More than 6000 abstracts and 950 original publications were manually screened, leading to 1785 human genes, 993 mouse genes, and 583 rat genes finally included in the database. All the collected genes were experimentally proved to be regulated by androgen at the expression level or to contain androgen-responsive regions. For each gene important details of the androgen regulation experiments were collected from references, such as expression change, androgen-responsive sequence, response time, tissue/cell type, experimental method, ligand identity, and androgen amount, which will facilitate further evaluation by researchers. Furthermore, the database was integrated with multiple annotation resources, including National Center for Biotechnology Information, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, to reveal the biological characteristics and significance of androgen-regulated genes. The ARGDB web site is mainly composed of the Browse, Search, Element Scan, and Submission modules. It is user friendly and freely accessible at http://argdb.fudan.edu.cn. Preliminary analysis of the collected data was performed. Many disease pathways, such as prostate carcinogenesis, were found to be enriched in androgen-regulated genes. The discovered androgen-response motifs were similar to those in previous reports. The analysis results are displayed in the web site. In conclusion, ARGDB provides a unified gateway to storage, retrieval, and update of information on androgen-regulated genes.},

	Abstract = {The aim of our study was to assess the importance of the CXC chemokine and interleukin (IL)-8 in promoting the transition of prostate cancer (CaP) to the androgen-independent state. Stimulation of the androgen-dependent cell lines, LNCaP and 22Rv1, with exogenous recombinant human interleukin-8 (rh-IL-8) increased androgen receptor (AR) gene expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Using an androgen response element-luciferase construct, we demonstrated that rh-IL-8 treatment also resulted in increased AR transcriptional activity in both these cell lines, and a subsequent upregulation of prostate-specific antigen and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 mRNA transcript levels in LNCaP cells. Blockade of CXC chemokine receptor-2 signaling using a small molecule antagonist (AZ10397767) attenuated the IL-8-induced increases in AR expression and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays, coadministration of AZ10397767 reduced the viability of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells exposed to bicalutamide. Our data show that IL-8 signaling increases AR expression and promotes ligand-independent activation of this receptor in two androgen-dependent cell lines, describing two mechanisms by which this chemokine may assist in promoting the transition of CaP to the androgen-independent state. In addition, our data show that IL-8-promoted regulation of the AR attenuates the effectiveness of the AR antagonist bicalutamide in reducing CaP cell viability.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitoxantrone plus prednisone reduces pain and improves the quality of life in men with advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, but it does not improve survival. We compared such treatment with docetaxel plus prednisone in men with this disease.
METHODS: From March 2000 through June 2002, 1006 men with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer received 5 mg of prednisone twice daily and were randomly assigned to receive 12 mg of mitoxantrone per square meter of body-surface area every three weeks, 75 mg of docetaxel per square meter every three weeks, or 30 mg of docetaxel per square meter weekly for five of every six weeks. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were pain, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and the quality of life. All statistical comparisons were against mitoxantrone.
RESULTS: As compared with the men in the mitoxantrone group, men in the group given docetaxel every three weeks had a hazard ratio for death of 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.94; P=0.009 by the stratified log-rank test) and those given weekly docetaxel had a hazard ratio for death of 0.91 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.11; P=0.36). The median survival was 16.5 months in the mitoxantrone group, 18.9 months in the group given docetaxel every 3 weeks, and 17.4 months in the group given weekly docetaxel. Among these three groups, 32 percent, 45 percent, and 48 percent of men, respectively, had at least a 50 percent decrease in the serum PSA level (P<0.001 for both comparisons with mitoxantrone); 22 percent, 35 percent (P=0.01), and 31 percent (P=0.08) had predefined reductions in pain; and 13 percent, 22 percent (P=0.009), and 23 percent (P=0.005) had improvements in the quality of life. Adverse events were also more common in the groups that received docetaxel.
CONCLUSIONS: When given with prednisone, treatment with docetaxel every three weeks led to superior survival and improved rates of response in terms of pain, serum PSA level, and quality of life, as compared with mitoxantrone plus prednisone.},

	Abstract = {Manipulation of differentiation programs has therapeutic potential in a spectrum of human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line, HL-60, to Retinoic Acid (RA). HL-60 is a human myeloblastic leukemia cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation programs. Initially, we focused on the role of the BLR1 receptor in RA-induced differentiation and G1/0-arrest in HL-60. BLR1, a putative G protein-coupled receptor expressed following RA exposure, is required for RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation and causes persistent MAPK signaling. A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type (wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell-lines with and without RA. The current model described the dynamics of 729 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 1356 interactions. An ensemble strategy was used to compensate for uncertain model parameters. The ensemble of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1 and MAPK signaling. The ensemble of models also correctly predicted Rb and p47phox regulation and the correlation between p21-CDK4-cyclin D formation and G1/0-arrest following exposure to RA. Finally, we investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses for future study. Taken together, the model presented here was a first step toward a systematic framework for analysis of programmed differentiation. These studies also demonstrated that mechanistic network modeling can help prioritize experimental directions by generating falsifiable hypotheses despite uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {Carcinoma of the breast and ovary account for one-third of all cancers occurring in women and together are responsible for approximately one-quarter of cancer-related deaths in females. The HER-2/neu proto-oncogene is amplified in 25 to 30 percent of human primary breast cancers and this alteration is associated with disease behavior. In this report, several similarities were found in the biology of HER-2/neu in breast and ovarian cancer, including a similar incidence of amplification, a direct correlation between amplification and over-expression, evidence of tumors in which overexpression occurs without amplification, and the association between gene alteration and clinical outcome. A comprehensive study of the gene and its products (RNA and protein) was simultaneously performed on a large number of both tumor types. This analysis identified several potential shortcomings of the various methods used to evaluate HER-2/neu in these diseases (Southern, Northern, and Western blots, and immunohistochemistry) and provided information regarding considerations that should be addressed when studying a gene or gene product in human tissue. The data presented further support the concept that the HER-2/neu gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of some human cancers.},

@article{Sobel2005,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: This is part 1 of a 2-part review. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the various aspects of prostate cancer (PCa) requires the use of in vivo and in vitro model systems. In the last few years many new cell lines have been established by investigators from primary tissue sources and clonal derivatives of previously established lines. Therefore, the purpose of this 2-part review is to catalogue the current human cell lines developed for PCa research, as reported in the literature. Part 1 includes tissue culture cell lines derived from metastases, primary tumors and nonadenocarcinomas that were established without the use of transgenes. It also includes a section describing lines that have been contaminated with other lines, shown not to be of prostatic origin or whose identity is being challenged.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostate cell lines included in this review were identified by extensive searching of the literature using several strategies, including PubMed searches and book chapter reviews.
RESULTS: In total we describe the derivation, phenotype, genotype and characterization of molecular markers expressed by approximately 200 lines and sublines used in PCa research, including those derived from primary tumors, metastases and normal prostate tissue. We paid particular attention to the expression of prostate specific antigen, androgen receptor, cytokeratins and other molecular markers used to indicate the status of PCa and the prostatic lineage of a given line. In an attempt to provide PCa researchers with a resource of information regarding new and established cell lines we have also created an online database of these PCa cell lines freely accessible via the World Wide Web at http://www.CaPCellLines.com. The web based interface allows researchers to peruse and print information regarding cell lines, add new cell lines and update or add new information regarding established cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: This compendium of cell lines currently used in PCa research combined with access to our on-line database provides researchers with a continually updated and valuable resource for investigating the molecular mechanisms of PCa.},

	Abstract = {Prostate cancer progresses from a hormone-sensitive, androgen-dependent stage to a hormone-refractory, androgen-independent tumor. The androgen receptor pathway functions in these androgen-independent tumors despite anti-androgen therapy. In our LAPC-4 prostate cancer model, androgen-independent sublines expressed higher levels of the HER-2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase than their androgen-dependent counterparts. Forced overexpression of HER-2/neu in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells allowed ligand-independent growth. HER-2/neu activated the androgen receptor pathway in the absence of ligand and synergized with low levels of androgen to 'superactivate' the pathway. By modulating the response to low doses of androgen, a tyrosine kinase receptor can restore androgen receptor function to prostate cancer cells, a finding directly related to the clinical progression of prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {The main cause of prostate cancer-related mortality is the development of hormone-refractory disease. Circulating serum levels of IL-6 are raised in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients and evidence from cell line studies suggests that the IL-6R/JAK/STAT3 pathway may be involved in development of this disease. In the current study we investigate if expression levels of these family members are implicated in the development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry using IL-6R, JAK1, STAT3, pSTAT3(Tyr705) and pSTAT3(Ser727) antibodies was performed on 50 matched hormone-sensitive and hormone-refractory tumours pairs. An increase in expression of cytoplasmic IL-6 receptor, with the development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer was associated with reduced time to relapse (P=0.0074) while an increase in expression of cytoplasmic pSTAT3(Tyr705) was associated with reduced patient survival (P=0.0003). In addition, those patients with high expression of cytoplasmic pSTAT3(Tyr705) in their hormone-refractory tumours had significantly shorter time to death from biochemical relapse and overall survival in comparison to those patients with low expression of cytoplasmic pSTAT3(Tyr705) (P=0.002 and P=0.0027, respectively). Activation of STAT3, via phosphorylation is associated with reduced patient survival, suggesting that activation of the IL-6R/JAK/STAT3 pathway is involved with development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {Despite evidence implicating the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, its precise role remains unclear. In this study we investigated the differential expression of IGF-I, IGF-II and their type I receptor (IGFR-I) in the epithelium and stroma of prostate neoplastic tissues. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques, we analyzed 43 paraffin-embedded prostatic samples and compared prostatic cancer (Pca) with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and its normal adjacent prostate (NAP) counterpart. We then determined a possible correlation of the immunohistochemical and in situ findings with two known prognostic clinical-pathological indices: Gleason score histological tumor grade and TNM clinical stage. In 22 of the 43 frozen prostatectomy specimens, IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFR-I mRNA expression were also evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Non neoplastic and neoplastic tissues examined contained detectable amounts of epithelial and stromal IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFR-I protein and mRNA; all levels increased significantly from normal tissue to PIN to Pca. In all three areas examined, IGFR-I expression was invariably higher in epithelium than in stroma, whereas expression of IGF ligands differed. In normal prostatic tissue, IGF-I and IGF-II expression was higher in stroma than in epithelium. Conversely, in Pca tissue, both factors were more strongly expressed in epithelial malignant cells. PIN areas showed IGF-I lowest, and IGF-II and IGFR-I levels highest in the epithelium. IGF-II protein and mRNA reached their highest levels in prostate tumors with high Gleason scores. These findings indicate that the IGF system changes as prostate tissue progresses from a normal to a malignant state. Differential expression of certain IGF system components in Pca may be associated with the malignant phenotype and more aggressive tumor behavior. Hence IGFs could serve to predict the outcome of prostatic cancer.},

@article{Heinlein2004,
	Abstract = {The normal development and maintenance of the prostate is dependent on androgen acting through the androgen receptor (AR). AR remains important in the development and progression of prostate cancer. AR expression is maintained throughout prostate cancer progression, and the majority of androgen-independent or hormone refractory prostate cancers express AR. Mutation of AR, especially mutations that result in a relaxation of AR ligand specificity, may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer and the failure of endocrine therapy by allowing AR transcriptional activation in response to antiandrogens or other endogenous hormones. Similarly, alterations in the relative expression of AR coregulators have been found to occur with prostate cancer progression and may contribute to differences in AR ligand specificity or transcriptional activity. Prostate cancer progression is also associated with increased growth factor production and an altered response to growth factors by prostate cancer cells. The kinase signal transduction cascades initiated by mitogenic growth factors modulate the transcriptional activity of AR and the interaction between AR and AR coactivators. The inhibition of AR activity through mechanisms in addition to androgen ablation, such as modulation of signal transduction pathways, may delay prostate cancer progression.},

	Abstract = {The PTEN tumor suppressor gene is frequently inactivated in human prostate cancers, particularly in more advanced cancers, suggesting that the AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) kinase, which is negatively regulated by PTEN, may be involved in human prostate cancer progression. We now show that AKT activation and activity are markedly increased in androgen-independent, prostate-specific antigen-positive prostate cancer cells (LNAI cells) established from xenograft tumors of the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line. These LNAI cells show increased expression of integrin-linked kinase, which is putatively responsible for AKT activation/Ser-473 phosphorylation, as well as for increased phosphorylation of the AKT target protein, BAD. Furthermore, expression of the p27(Kip1) cell cycle regulator was diminished in LNAI cells, consistent with the notion that AKT directly inhibits AFX/Forkhead-mediated transcription of p27(Kip1). To assess directly the impact of increased AKT activity on prostate cancer progression, an activated hAKT1 mutant was overexpressed in LNCaP cells, resulting in a 6-fold increase in xenograft tumor growth. Like LNAI cells, these transfectants showed dramatically reduced p27(Kip1) expression. Together, these data implicate increased AKT activity in prostate tumor progression and androgen independence and suggest that diminished p27(Kip1) expression, which has been repeatedly associated with prostate cancer progression, may be a consequence of increased AKT activity.},

@article{Takaishi1999,
	Abstract = {The regulation of intracellular localization of AFX, a human Forkhead transcription factor, was studied. AFX was recovered as a phosphoprotein from transfected COS-7 cells growing in the presence of FBS, and the phosphorylation was eliminated by wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. AFX was phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase B (PKB), a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, but a mutant protein in which three putative phosphorylation sites of PKB had been replaced by Ala was not recognized by PKB. In Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) cultured with serum, the AFX protein fused with green fluorescence protein (AFX-GFP) is localized mainly in the cytoplasm, and wortmannin induced transient nuclear translocation of the fusion protein. The AFX-GFP mutant in which all three phosphorylation sites had been replaced by Ala was detected exclusively in the cell nucleus. AFX-GFP was in the nucleus when the cells were infected with an adenovirus vector encoding a dominant-negative form of either PI 3-kinase or PKB, whereas the fusion protein stayed in the cytoplasm when the cells expressed constitutively active PKB. In CHO-K1 cells expressing AFX-GFP, DNA fragmentation was induced by the stable PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, and the expression of the active form of PKB suppressed this DNA fragmentation. The phosphorylation site mutant of AFX-GFP enhanced DNA fragmentation irrespective of the presence and absence of PI 3-kinase inhibitor. These results indicate that the nuclear translocation of AFX is negatively regulated through its phosphorylation by PKB.},

	Abstract = {The Forkhead transcription factors AFX, FKHR and FKHR-L1 are orthologues of DAF-16, a Forkhead factor that regulates longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we show that overexpression of these Forkhead transcription factors causes growth suppression in a variety of cell lines, including a Ras-transformed cell line and a cell line lacking the tumour suppressor PTEN. Expression of AFX blocks cell-cycle progression at phase G1, independent of functional retinoblastoma protein (pRb) but dependent on the cell-cycle inhibitor p27kip1. Indeed, AFX transcriptionally activates p27kip1, resulting in increased protein levels. We conclude that AFX-like proteins are involved in cell-cycle regulation and that inactivation of these proteins is an important step in oncogenic transformation.},

In this study, we demonstrate that Akt also regulates the activity of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors. In the presence of survival factors, Akt phosphorylates FKHRL1, leading to FKHRL1's association with 14-3-3 proteins and FKHRL1's retention in the cytoplasm. Survival factor withdrawal leads to FKHRL1 dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and target gene activation. Within the nucleus, FKHRL1 triggers apoptosis most likely by inducing the expression of genes that are critical for cell death, such as the Fas ligand gene.},

	Abstract = {Cdc25B is a dual-specific phosphatase that mediates cell cycle progression by activating the cyclin-dependent kinases. It has been shown to possess oncogenic potential. To elucidate its potential contribution to human prostate cancer development, the expression profile of Cdc25B protein in human patients was analysed by immunohistocytochemistry. Cdc25B is frequently overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissues (29 of 30; 97%). In addition, the overexpression is more profound in the tumors of high combined Gleason scores and in late stages. Subsequently, we demonstrated that Cdc25B acts as a coactivator for AR in a hormone-dependent manner in the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. This coactivator function, surprisingly, is independent of its cell cycle functions. Cdc25B, on the other hand, directly interacts with AR as evidenced in GST-pull down and mammalian two-hybrid assays. In addition, it is also able to enhance AR-mediated transcription in synergy with other coactivators, including CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP associated factor. Therefore, upregulation of Cdc25B in human prostate cancer and its interplay with AR may contribute to prostate cancer development.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) activity is required for prostate growth, differentiation, and secretion. Deregulation of AR activity results in inappropriate mitogenic signaling and is thought to contribute both to the initiation and progression of prostate cancers. Cyclin D1 functions as a strong AR corepressor by directly interacting with and inhibiting receptor activity. However, the extent to which cyclin D1 functions to inhibit AR activity under conditions associated with cancer progression has not been determined. We now demonstrate that cyclin D1 action is conserved in multiple tumor cell backgrounds, inhibiting AR-dependent gene activation in breast, bladder, and androgen-independent prostatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. In androgen-dependent prostatic adenocarcinomas, cyclin D1 effectively muted androgen-stimulated target gene expression in a manner analogous to dominant negative ARs. The ability of cyclin D1 to inhibit AR activity was conserved with regard to target promoter, repressing transactivation from mouse mammary tumor virus, probasin, and prostate-specific antigen promoters. Inappropriate, nonligand AR activation, postulated to act through regulation of receptor phosphorylation, was also sensitive to cyclin D1 regulation. Moreover, we show that several phosphorylation site mutants of the AR were equally inhibited by cyclin D1 as compared with the wild-type receptor. Given these data establishing the potency of cyclin D1-mediated repression, we evaluated the ability of cyclin D1 to inhibit tumor-derived AR alleles and polymorphisms associated with tumor progression and increased prostate cancer risk. We demonstrate that the AR alleles and polymorphisms tested respond completely to cyclin D1 corepressor activity. In addition, activation of a common tumor-derived AR allele by 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone was inhibited through ectopic expression of cyclin D1. Taken together, these data establish the potency of cyclin D1 as an AR corepressor and provide support for additional studies examining the efficacy of developing novel prostate cancer therapies for both androgen-dependent and -independent tumors.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor and its activity is regulated by numerous AR coregulators. Aberrant expression of AR coregulators in prostate cancer cells has an important role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. We report here that CDC25A, a cell cycle-promoting phosphatase over-expressed in a number of cancers, functions as an AR coregulator suppressing the AR transcriptional activity. In this study, we found that CDC25A is upregulated in human prostate cancer and its expression level is positively associated with the Gleason score and disease metastasis. More importantly, we showed that CDC25A can physically interact with AR through its putative catalytic domain. In addition, ectopic expression of CDC25A in prostate cancer cell lines suppresses PSA and Probasin promoter activities significantly, indicating that CDC25A may function as an AR corepressor. This was further confirmed by knockdown of endogenous CDC25A expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA), which resulted in upregulation of PSA promoter activity. Moreover, a truncated mutant that does not interact with AR fails to suppress the PSA promoter activity, indicating that CDC25A downregulates androgen-responsive promoter by physically interacting with AR. Taken together, our results demonstrated a novel function of CDC25A in the regulation of androgen signaling in human prostate cancer cells.},

@article{Sato1997,
	Abstract = {In exploring the possible mechanisms of androgen independence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gene expression, we investigated the effect of elevating AP-1 by both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) treatment and transfection of the c-Jun expression vector in LNCaP cells. Transcription of PSA is initiated when ligand-activated androgen receptor (AR) binds to a region in the PSA promoter that contains an androgen-responsive element (ARE). It was found that TPA inhibited androgen-induced PSA gene expression by a mechanism that did not alter nuclear levels of AR protein. Overexpression of AP-1 (jun and fos proteins) also inhibited androgen-induced PSA promoter activity. These observations were apparently related to the disruption of AR.ARE complexes as demonstrated by the results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Specifically, c-Jun inhibited the formation of AR.ARE complexes and conversely that AR-glutathione S-transferase proteins inhibited the formation of c-Jun.TPA-responsive element (TRE) complexes. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of both proteins, anti-c-Jun antibody blocked the inhibition of AR.ARE complex formation by c-Jun. A similar, but less marked, effect was obtained when anti-AR antibody was used to prevent AR inhibition of c-Jun.TRE complex formation. These findings together with results obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments strongly suggest that mutual repression of DNA binding activity is due to direct interaction between the two proteins and that the degree of repression may be determined by the ratio of AR to c-Jun. The mechanism of repression studied in mutant analysis experiments yielded evidence of an interaction between the DNA- and ligand-binding domains of AR and the leucine zipper region of c-Jun. Thus, the AR is similar to other nuclear receptors in its ability to interact with AP-1. This association provides a link between AP-1 and AR signal transduction pathways and may play a role in the regulation of the androgen-responsive PSA gene.},

	Abstract = {Retinoblastoma (RB; encoded by RB1) is a tumor suppressor that is frequently disrupted in tumorigenesis and acts in multiple cell types to suppress cell cycle progression. The role of RB in tumor progression, however, is poorly defined. Here, we have identified a critical role for RB in protecting against tumor progression through regulation of targets distinct from cell cycle control. In analyses of human prostate cancer samples, RB loss was infrequently observed in primary disease and was predominantly associated with transition to the incurable, castration-resistant state. Further analyses revealed that loss of the RB1 locus may be a major mechanism of RB disruption and that loss of RB function was associated with poor clinical outcome. Modeling of RB dysfunction in vitro and in vivo revealed that RB controlled nuclear receptor networks critical for tumor progression and that it did so via E2F transcription factor 1-mediated regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression and output. Through this pathway, RB depletion induced unchecked AR activity that underpinned therapeutic bypass and tumor progression. In agreement with these findings, disruption of the RB/E2F/nuclear receptor axis was frequently observed in the transition to therapy resistance in human disease. Together, these data reveal what we believe to be a new paradigm for RB function in controlling prostate tumor progression and lethal tumor phenotypes.},

Inactivation of Rb has been regarded as an important event in prostate carcinogenesis. However, the detailed mechanism of how Rb is linked to androgen-androgen receptor (A-AR), the major factor in promotion of prostate tumor growth, remains unclear. Using GST-Rb pull down assay and mammalian two-hybrid system, we report here that Rb can bind specifically to AR in an androgen-independent manner. Transient transfection assay demonstrates that cotransfection of AR and Rb can further induce AR transcriptional activity 4-fold in the presence of 1 nM dihydrotestosterone in DU145 cells. Interestingly, cotransfection of Rb and ARA70, the first identified AR coactivator, with AR can additively induce AR transcriptional activity 13-fold (from 5-fold to 64-fold). In conclusion, our discovery that Rb can function as a coactivator to induce AR transcriptional activity in prostate cells may represent the first data to link a negative growth regulatory protein function in a positive manner, by inducing the transcriptional activity of AR.},

Most prostate tumors regress after therapy to prevent testosterone production by the testes, but the tumors eventually recur and cause death. A critical question is whether the androgen receptor mediates recurrent tumor growth after androgen deprivation therapy. Here we report that a majority of recurrent prostate cancers express high levels of the androgen receptor and two nuclear receptor coactivators, transcriptional intermediary factor 2 and steroid receptor coactivator 1. Overexpression of these coactivators increases androgen receptor transactivation at physiological concentrations of adrenal androgen. Furthermore, we provide a molecular basis for this activation and suggest a general mechanism for recurrent prostate cancer growth.},

Moreover, aberrant androgen action plays a critical role in multiple pathologies, including prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndromes. The formation of a productive AR transcriptional complex requires the functional and structural interaction of the AR with its coregulators. In the last decade, an overwhelming and ever increasing number of proteins have been proposed to possess AR coactivating or corepressing characteristics. Intriguingly, a vast diversity of functions has been ascribed to these proteins, indicating that a multitude of cellular functions and signals converge on the AR to regulate its function. The current review aims to provide an overview of the AR coregulator proteins identified to date and to propose a classification of these AR coregulator proteins according to the function(s) ascribed to them. Taken together, this approach will increase our understanding of the cellular pathways that converge on the AR to ensure an appropriate transcriptional response to androgens.},

	Abstract = {The biological ramifications of phosphorylation of the androgen receptor (AR) are largely unknown. To examine the phosphorylation of AR at serine 213, a putative substrate for Akt, a phosphorylation site-specific antibody was generated. The use of this antibody indicated that AR Ser-213 is phosphorylated in vivo and that phosphorylation is tightly regulated in a cell type-specific manner. Furthermore, Ser-213 phosphorylation took place with rapid kinetics and was inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Phosphorylation occurred in response to R1881 and dihydrotestosterone but weakly if at all in response to testosterone. It did not occur in response to AR antagonists or growth factor stimulation in the absence of an AR agonist. Transcription assays using an AR-responsive reporter gene construct showed that activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibited transcription mediated by wild type AR but not that of a mutant AR variant (S213A), which could not be phosphorylated at Ser-213. By immunohistochemistry, the AR Ser(P)-213 antigen was detected in prostate epithelial but not stromal cells despite the fact that an antibody recognizing both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of AR demonstrates that AR is present in both cell types as expected. In fetal tissue the AR-Ser(P)-213 antigen was present in epithelial cells of the urogenital sinus when endogenous androgen levels were high and activated Akt was prevalent, but absent at a later stage of development when endogenous androgen levels were low and Akt activation was minimal. Immunoreactivity was evident in differentiated cells lining the lumen of the urogenital sinus but not in rapidly dividing, Ki67 positive cells within the developing prostate or stromal tissue, suggesting that site-specific phosphorylation of AR Ser-213 by cellular kinases occurs in a non-proliferating cellular milieu.},

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a critical survival pathway for prostate cancer cells, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the principal treatment for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease. Although a majority of patients initially respond to ADT, most will eventually develop castrate resistance, defined as disease progression despite serum testosterone levels of <20 ng/dl. The recent discovery that AR signaling persists during systemic castration via intratumoral production of androgens led to the development of novel anti-androgen therapies including abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. Although these agents effectively palliate symptoms and prolong life, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains incurable. An increased understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of castrate resistance is therefore needed to develop novel therapeutic approaches for this disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the current literature on the biology and treatment of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 10 June 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.206.},

	Abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) binds to and is activated by cyclin D1 and thereby enhances the transition of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The present study indicates that, in human prostate cancer cells, CDK6 can also bind to the androgen receptor (AR) and stimulate its transcriptional activity in the presence of dihydrotestosterone. This effect of CDK6 does not require its kinase activity and is inhibited by cyclin D1 and p16INK4a. The T877A mutant of the AR frequently found in advanced cases of prostate cancer displays an exaggerated stimulation of transcriptional activity by CDK6. Androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells engineered to stably overexpress CDK6 display increased expression of the prostate-specific antigen and enhanced growth in the presence of dihydrotestosterone. CDK6 is present in the chromatin structure of these cells in association with the AR and the promoter region of the prostate-specific antigen gene. These findings suggest that CDK6 may play an important role in the development and/or progression of a subset of human prostate cancers by stimulating the activity of the AR.},

@article{Brinkmann1999,
	Abstract = {Androgens play a crucial role in several stages of male development and in the maintenance of the male phenotype. Androgens act in their target cells via an interaction with the androgen receptor, resulting in direct regulation of gene expression. The androgen receptor is a phosphoprotein and modulation of the phosphorylation status of the receptor influences ligand-binding and consequently transcription activation of androgen responsive genes. Androgen binding induces a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain, accompanied by additional receptor phosphorylation. Subsequently the liganded androgen receptor interacts with specific androgen response elements in the regulatory regions of androgen target genes, resulting in stimulation of gene expression. Anti-androgens induce a different conformational change of the ligand-binding domain, which does not or only partially result in stimulation of transactivation. Interestingly, different anti-androgens can induce different inactive conformations of the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. Recent evidence strongly supports a ligand dependent functional interaction between the ligand-binding domain and the NH2-terminal transactivating domain of the androgen receptor. Two regions in the NH2-terminal domain are involved in this interaction, whereas in the ligand-binding domain the AF-2 AD core region is involved.},

	Abstract = {Growth of prostatic epithelial cells is androgen-dependent; however, the mechanism of androgen action on cell growth is not well defined. We investigated whether androgen-dependent prostatic epithelial cell growth is mediated by androgen regulation of expression of genes controlling cell cycle progression. For this purpose, we used an androgen-dependent prostatic cancer cell line, LNCaP-FGC, as an in vitro model. We found that expression of CDK2 and CDK4 genes were up-regulated within hours of androgen treatment as detected in Northern and Western blot analyses. Kinase assay also confirmed that there was increased CDK2 kinase activity upon androgen stimulation. Moreover, androgen down-regulated expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 (MTS1, CDKN2) gene. The overall effects of these androgen actions result in an increased cyclin-dependent kinase activity and stimulation of the cell to enter S phase of the cell cycle, thereby enhancing cell proliferation. In contrast, an androgen-independent PC-3 cell line lost its response to androgen stimulation, and higher basal levels of CDK2, CDK4, and p16 genes were constitutively expressed in PC-3 cells. Collectively, these data suggest a possible signaling pathway of androgen in stimulating cell growth. These results also imply that in androgen-dependent prostate cancer, increased androgen receptor (AR) activity, resulting from AR gain-of-function mutations, AR gene amplification, or AR gene overexpression, malignantly stimulates proliferation of prostatic epithelial cells and constitutes one possible mechanism of androgen-dependent tumorigenesis.},

	Abstract = {The LNCaP cell line was established from a metastatic lesion of human prostatic adenocarcinoma. The LNCaP cells grow readily in vitro (up to 8 x 10(5) cells/sq cm; doubling time, 60 hr), form clones in semisolid media, are highly resistant to human fibroblast interferon, and show an aneuploid (modal number, 76 to 91) human male karyotype with several marker chromosomes. The malignant properties of LNCaP cells are maintained. Athymic nude mice develop tumors at the injection site (volume-doubling time, 86 hr). Functional differentiation is preserved; both cultures and tumor produce acid phosphatase. High-affinity specific androgen receptors are present in the cytosol and nuclear fractions of cells in culture and in tumors. Estrogen receptors are demonstrable in the cytosol. The model is hormonally responsive. In vitro, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone modulates cell growth and stimulates acid phosphatase production. In vivo, the frequency of tumor development and the mean time of tumor appearance are significantly different for either sex. Male mice develop tumors earlier and at a greater frequency than do females. Hormonal manipulations show that, regardless of sex, the frequency of tumor development correlates with serum androgen levels. The rate of the tumor growth, however, is independent of the gender of hormonal status of the host.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The acquisition of an androgen-independent phenotype is the most serious issue of prostate cancer treatment. Although several experimental cell models have been reported for studying androgen independence, they have limited applications related to hormone-refractory prostate cancer. To investigate the molecular mechanism of androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer, we established a useful LNCaP cell model that resembles the clinical scenario of hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
METHODS: Androgen-sensitive LNCaP parental cells were continuously maintained in a regular cell-culture medium, that is, phenol red-positive RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine. Upon passage, the androgen responsiveness of those cells decreased, to a level lower than that of parental cells. We examined the growth properties and androgen responsiveness of these different LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Cytogenetic characteristics and expression of androgen receptors (ARs) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were determined.
RESULTS: Upon continuous passage, the biological behavior of parental C-33 cells (passage number less than 33) was altered. C-81 cells (passage number higher than 81) clearly exhibited more aggressive growth and lower androgen responsiveness than C-33 and C-51 cells (passage number between 35 and 80) in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, all these cells expressed a similar level of functional AR protein as well as a similar genetic profile. Moreover, in a steroid-reduced culture condition, C-81 cells secreted a higher level of PSA than C-33 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our LNCaP cell model closely recapitulates the progression of human prostate cancer from the androgen-responsive to the hormone-refractory state under the androgen nondeprived condition. This cell model may provide the opportunity to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with the acquisition of androgen independence during human prostate cancer progression.},

Alternatives to standard androgen deprivation therapy, such as intermittent androgen suppression and estrogen therapy, hold the potential to improve toxicity profiles while maintaining clinical benefit. Current androgen deprivation strategies seem to incompletely suppress androgen levels and androgen-receptor-mediated effects at the tissue level. Advances in the understanding of mechanisms that contribute to castration-resistant prostate cancer are leading to rationally designed therapies targeting androgen metabolism and the androgen receptor. The results of large trials investigating the optimization of primary androgen deprivation therapy, including evaluation of intermittent androgen suppression and phase III studies of novel androgen synthesis inhibitors, such as abiraterone acetate, are eagerly awaited.},

A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.5% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4%), cancers of the stomach (3.1%) and colorectum (3.0%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations.},

	Abstract = {We have previously shown that PKC inhibitors interfere with the Ets1/Smad3-dependent regulation of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) P3 promoter activity by TGFbeta in invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. By examining PKC expression in a variety of breast cancer cell lines, the protein level of PKCalpha was found to be much higher in Ets1-expressing MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells than in Ets1-deficient MCF-7 and SK-BR3 cells. No correlation of Ets1 expression with the expression of other PKC subtypes (PKCbeta1, PKCbeta2, PKCdelta or PKCepsilon) could be observed. In contrast to MDA-MB-231 cells, PKCalpha-deficient MCF-7 cells do not support Ets1-induced activation of the PTHrP P3 promoter suggesting that PKCalpha may be important for Ets1 activity. A constitutively active form of PKCalpha was found to potentiate the P3 promoter activation by Ets1 alone and in synergy with Smad3. PKCalpha, but not PKCepsilon, also induced phosphorylation of the Ets1 protein. Both PKCalpha effects on Ets1 depended on the exon VII domain of Ets1. Using verapamil and ionomycin, we could show that PKCalpha induces Ets1 phosphorylation independent of calcium mobilization. Collectively, our data suggest that PKCalpha may regulate Ets1 activity in invasive breast cancer cells.},

	Abstract = {In an often rapidly changing environment, cells must adapt by monitoring and reacting quickly to extracellular stimuli detected by membrane-bound receptors and proteins. Reversible phosphorylation of intracellular regulatory proteins has emerged as a crucial mechanism effecting the transmission and modulation of such signals and is determined by the relative activities of protein kinases and phosphatases within the cell. These are often arranged into complex signaling networks that may function independently or be subject to cross-regulation. Recently, genetic and biochemical analyses have identified the universally conserved mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade as one of the most ubiquitous signal transduction systems. This pathway is activated after a variety of cellular stimuli and regulates numerous physiological processes, particularly the cell division cycle. Progression through the cell cycle is critically dependent on the presence of environmental growth factors and stress stimuli, and failure to correctly integrate such signals into the cell cycle machinery can lead to the accumulation of genetic damage and genomic instability characteristic of cancer cells. Here we focus on the MAP kinase cascade and discuss the molecular mechanisms by which these extensively studied signaling pathways influence cell growth and proliferation.},

	Abstract = {Models of biochemical regulation in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, typically consisting of a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations, have become increasingly popular of late. These systems have large numbers of poorly known parameters, simplified dynamics, and uncertain connectivity: three key features of a class of problems we call sloppy models, which are shared by many other high-dimensional multiparameter nonlinear models. We use a statistical ensemble method to study the behavior of these models, in order to extract as much useful predictive information as possible from a sloppy model, given the available data used to constrain it. We discuss numerical challenges that emerge in using the ensemble method for a large system. We characterize features of sloppy model parameter fluctuations by various spectral decompositions and find indeed that five parameters can be used to fit an elephant. We also find that model entropy is as important to the problem of model choice as model energy is to parameter choice.},

	Abstract = {The tyrosine kinase Src is frequently activated in advanced human prostate carcinomas and its activation correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of the RNA-binding protein Sam68. Herein, we have investigated the expression and function of Sam68 in human prostate cancer cells. Analysis of specimens obtained from 20 patients revealed that Sam68 is upregulated at the protein level in 35% of the samples. Real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the results at the mRNA level in most patients. Downregulation of Sam68 by RNAi in LNCaP prostate cancer cells delayed cell cycle progression and reduced the proliferation rate. Moreover, depletion of Sam68 sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by DNA-damaging agents. Similarly, stable cell lines expressing a truncated GFP-Sam68(GSG) protein displayed reduced growth rates and higher sensitivity to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Microarray analyses revealed that a subset of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis were altered when Sam68 was knocked down in LNCaP cells. Our results indicate that Sam68 expression supports prostate cancer cells proliferation and survival to cytotoxic agents.},

	Abstract = {Prostate cancers (PCa) that relapse after androgen deprivation therapies [castration-resistant PCa (CRPC)] express high levels of androgen receptor (AR) and androgen-regulated genes, and evidence from several groups indicates that ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinases [epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2] may contribute to enhancing this AR activity. We found that activation of these kinases with EGF and heregulin-beta1 rapidly (within 8 hours) decreased expression of endogenous AR and androgen-regulated PSA in LNCaP PCa cells. AR expression was similarly decreased in LAPC4 and C4-2 cells, but not in the CWR22Rv1 PCa cell line. The rapid decrease in AR was not due to increased AR protein degradation and was not blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002) or MEK (UO126) inhibitors. Significantly, AR mRNA levels in LNCaP cells were markedly decreased by EGF and heregulin-beta1, and experiments with actinomycin D to block new mRNA synthesis showed that AR mRNA degradation was increased. AR mRNA levels were still markedly decreased by EGF and heregulin-beta1 in LNCaP cells adapted to growth in androgen-depleted medium, although AR protein levels did not decline due to increased AR protein stability. These findings show that EGFR and ErbB2 can negatively regulate AR mRNA and may provide an approach to suppress AR expression in CRPC.},

@article{Chen2011,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with recurrent prostate cancer are commonly treated with androgen withdrawal therapy (AWT); however, almost all patients eventually progress to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), indicating failure of AWT to eliminate androgen-sensitive prostate cancer. The overall goal of these studies is to determine whether dual inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 would prolong the effectiveness of this treatment in prostate cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and its CRPC sublines LNCaP-AI and C4-2. Additional data were collected in pRNS-1-1 cells stably expressing a mutant androgen receptor (AR-T877A), and in nude mice harboring CWR22 tumors. Studies utilized EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and AG1478, and HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab and AG879.
RESULTS: Dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition induced apoptosis selectively in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells undergoing AWT, but not in the presence of androgens, or in CRPC cells. We show that AWT alone failed to induce significant apoptosis in androgen-dependent cells, due to AWT-induced increase in HER2 and ErbB3, which promoted survival by increasing Akt phosphorylation. AWT-induced ErbB3 stabilized the AR and stimulated PSA, while it was inactivated only by inhibition of both its dimerization partners EGFR and HER2 (prostate cancer cells do not express ErbB4); but not the inhibition of any one receptor alone, explaining the success of dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition in sensitizing androgen-dependent cells to AWT. The effectiveness of the inhibitors in suppressing growth correlated with its ability to prevent Akt phosphorylation.
CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition, administered together with AWT, sensitize prostate cancer cells to apoptosis during AWT.},

	Abstract = {Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase (cPAcP), an authentic tyrosine phosphatase, is proposed to function as a negative growth regulator of prostate cancer (PCa) cells in part through its dephosphorylation of ErbB-2. Nevertheless, the direct interaction between cPAcP and ErbB-2 has not been shown nor the specific dephosphorylation site of ErbB-2 by cPAcP. In this report, our data show that the phosphorylation level of ErbB-2 primarily at Tyr(1221/2) correlates with the growth rate of both LNCaP and MDA PCa2b human PCa cells. Further, cPAcP reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with ErbB-2 in a non-permissive growth condition. Expression of wild type cPAcP, but not inactive mutant, by cDNA in cPAcP-null LNCaP C-81 cells results in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 including Tyr(1221/2). Concurrently, Tyr(317) phosphorylation of p52(Shc), proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and cell growth are decreased in these cells. Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression by short hairpin RNA in LNCaP C-33 cells was associated with elevated phosphorylation of ErbB-2 initially at Tyr(1221/2). Its downstream p52(Shc), ERK1/2, Akt, Src, STAT-3, and STAT-5 were activated, and cell proliferation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and cyclin D1 expression were increased. Stable subclones of C-33 cells by small interfering PAcP had elevated Tyr(1221/2) phosphorylation of ErbB-2 and exhibited androgen-independent growth and increased tumorigenicity in xenograft female animals. In summary, our data together indicate that in prostate epithelia, cPAcP interacts with and dephosphorylates ErbB-2 primarily at Tyr(1221/2) and hence blocks downstream signaling, leading to reduced cell growth. In PCa cells, decreased cPAcP expression is associated with androgen-independent cell proliferation and tumorigenicity as seen in advanced hormone-refractory prostate carcinomas.},

	Abstract = {Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), an ErbB1 ligand and prostate stromal growth factor, is an antagonist of androgen receptor (AR) function. In the LNCaP prostate cancer model, HB-EGF reduced AR protein levels and AR transactivation without affecting AR mRNA level or protein turnover. The signal to attenuate AR was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin, as shown by genetic and pharmacologic methods, and was independent of ErbB2/HER-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Additional evidence suggests that AR protein levels are highly sensitive to regulation by cap-dependent mRNA translation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for regulation of AR by a classic growth factor system and indicate that a rapamycin-sensitive post-transcriptional pathway can attenuate or possibly bypass AR-mediated signaling.},

	Abstract = {Activation of E2F transcription factors, through disruption of the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor-suppressor gene, is a key event in the development of many human cancers. Previously, we showed that homozygous deletion of Rb in a prostate tissue recombination model exhibits increased E2F activity, activation of E2F-target genes, and increased susceptibility to hormonal carcinogenesis. In this study, we examined the expression of E2F1 in 667 prostate tissue cores and compared it with the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), a marker of prostate epithelial differentiation, using tissue microarray analysis. We show that E2F1 expression is low in benign and localized prostate cancer, modestly elevated in metastatic lymph nodes from hormone-na{\"\i}ve patients, and significantly elevated in metastatic tissues from hormone-resistant prostate cancer patients (P = 0.0006). In contrast, strong AR expression was detected in benign prostate (83%), localized prostate cancer (100%), and lymph node metastasis (80%), but decreased to 40% in metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (P = 0.004). Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed elevated E2F1 mRNA levels and increased levels of the E2F-target genes dihyrofolate reductase and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in metastatic hormone-independent prostate cancer cases compared with benign tissues. To identify a role of E2F1 in hormone-independent prostate cancer, we examined whether E2F1 can regulate AR expression. We show that exogenous expression of E2F1 significantly inhibited AR mRNA and AR protein levels in prostate epithelial cells. E2F1 also inhibited an AR promoter-luciferase construct that was dependent on the transactivation domain of E2F1. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we show that E2F1 and the pocket protein family members p107 and p130 bind to the AR promoter in vivo. Taken together, these results show that elevated E2F1, through its ability to repress AR transcription, may contribute to the progression of hormone-independent prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer (PCa) growth, with androgen deprivation or AR down-regulation causing cell-cycle arrest and accumulation of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The molecular basis for this AR regulation of cell-cycle progression remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that androgen can rapidly reduce p27 protein in PCa cells by increasing its proteasome-mediated degradation. This rapid androgen-stimulated p27 degradation was mediated by AKT through the phosphorylation of p27 T157. Significantly, androgen increased TORC2-mediated AKT S473 phosphorylation without affecting the PDK1-mediated AKT T308 phosphorylation or TORC1 activity. The TORC2 activation was further supported by enhanced mTOR/RICTOR association and increased phosphorylation of additional TORC2 substrates, SGK1 and PKCα. The androgen-stimulated nuclear translocation of AR was associated with markedly-increased nuclear SIN1, a critical component of TORC2. Finally, the androgen-mediated TORC2/AKT activation targets a subset of AKT substrates including p27 and FOXO1, but not PRAS40. This study reveals a pathway linking AR to a selective activation of TORC2, the subsequent activation of AKT, and phosphorylation of a discrete set of AKT substrates that regulate cellular proliferation and survival. These findings establish that TORC2 can function as a central regulator of growth in response to signals that are distinct from those regulating TORC1, and support efforts to target TORC2 for cancer therapy.},

	Abstract = {The control of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) productivity in a continuous bioreactor with cell recycle is studied by simulation. A cybernetic model of PHB synthesis in Alcaligenes eutrophus is developed. Model parameters are identified using experimental data, and simulation results are presented. The model is interfaced to a multirate model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. PHB productivity and concentration are controlled by manipulating dilution rate and recycle ratio. Unmeasured time varying disturbances are imposed to study regulatory control performance, including unreachable setpoints. With proper controller tuning, the nonlinear MPC algorithm can track productivity and concentration setpoints despite a change in the sign of PHB productivity gain with respect to dilution rate. It is shown that the nonlinear MPC algorithm is able to track the maximum achievable productivity for unreachable setpoints under significant process/model mismatch. The impact of model uncertainty upon controller performance is explored. The multirate MPC algorithm is tested using three controllers employing models that vary in complexity of regulation. It is shown that controller performance deteriorates as a function of decreasing biological complexity.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Activation of the epidermal growth factor pathway is important in prostate cancer development and the transcription of androgen receptor regulated genes. This study evaluated the potential activity of lapatinib in men with biochemically-relapsed androgen-dependent (stage D0) prostate cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with a rising PSA after primary therapy for prostate cancer were enrolled. A PSA doubling time (PSADT) <12 months was required. Lapatinib was administered at 1,500 mg orally daily. Outcome measures were changes in PSA kinetics. Primary tumor blocks were obtained and assessed for EGFR expression, EGFR Q787Q polymorphism, and Kras 38 mutational status.
RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled (14 ineligible), resulting in 35 patients for analysis. No PSA response was observed; best response was stable disease (n = 28, 80.0%). Pretreatment average slope was 0.19 log (PSA)/month (PSADT = 3.70 months), in contrast to on-treatment average slope of 0.13 log (PSA)/month (PSADT = 5.44 months) using linear mixed effects models (P = 0.006). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 17.4 months for the high EGFR group and 6.0 months for the low EGFR group (P = 0.50). Patients with Kras 38 mutation had shorter PFS than those without Kras 38 mutation (P = 0.09).
CONCLUSION: Although no PSA responses (primary endpoint) was observed, lapatinib may have biologic activity in men with stage D0 prostate cancer as evidenced by a decrease in PSA slope in this non-randomized study. Additional trials assessing the role of EGFR overexpression and Kras wild type status in prostate cancer should be investigated.},

	Abstract = {Elevated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) function induces malignancy in experimental models by selectively enhancing translation of key malignancy-related mRNAs (c-myc and BCL-2). eIF4E activation may reflect increased eIF4E expression or phosphorylation of its inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BP). By immunohistochemical analyses of 148 tissues from 89 prostate cancer patients, we now show that both eIF4E expression and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (p4E-BP1) are increased significantly, particularly in advanced prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Further, increased eIF4E and p4E-BP1 levels are significantly related to reduced patient survival, whereas uniform 4E-BP1 expression is significantly related to better patient survival. Both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting reveal that elevated eIF4E and p4E-BP1 are evident in the same prostate cancer tissues. In two distinct prostate cancer cell models, the progression to androgen independence also involves increased eIF4E activation. In these prostate cancer cells, reducing eIF4E expression with an eIF4E-specific antisense oligonucleotide currently in phase I clinical trials robustly induces apoptosis, regardless of cell cycle phase, and reduces expression of the eIF4E-regulated proteins BCL-2 and c-myc. Collectively, these data implicate eIF4E activation in prostate cancer and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be attractive for prostate cancer therapy.},

	Abstract = {Growth of normal and neoplastic prostate is mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor activated by high affinity androgen binding. The AR is highly expressed in recurrent prostate cancer cells that proliferate despite reduced circulating androgen. In this report, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases androgen-dependent AR transactivation in the recurrent prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1 through a mechanism that involves a post-transcriptional increase in the p160 coactivator transcriptional intermediary factor 2/glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (TIF2/GRIP1). Site-specific mutagenesis and selective MAPK inhibitors linked the EGF-induced increase in AR transactivation to phosphorylation of TIF2/GRIP1. EGF signaling increased the coimmunoprecipitation of TIF2 and AR. AR transactivation and its stimulation by EGF were reduced by small interfering RNA inhibition of TIF2/GRIP1 expression. The data indicate that EGF signaling through MAPK increases TIF2/GRIP1 coactivation of AR transactivation in recurrent prostate cancer.},

Here, we report that tyrosine phosphorylation of AR is induced by growth factors and elevated in hormone-refractory prostate tumors. Mutation of the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in AR significantly inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells under androgen-depleted conditions. The Src tyrosine kinase appears to be responsible for phosphorylating AR, and there is a positive correlation of AR tyrosine phosphorylation with Src tyrosine kinase activity in human prostate tumors. Our data collectively suggest that growth factors and their downstream tyrosine kinases, which are elevated during hormone-ablation therapy, can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of AR and such modification may be important for prostate tumor growth under androgen-depleted conditions.},

@article{Ha2011,
	Abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence suggest a functional link between the androgen receptor (AR) and the serine/threonine kinase Akt in the development and progression of prostate cancer. To investigate the impact of Akt activity on AR homeostasis, we treated androgen-dependent LNCaP and LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells with Akt inhibitor. Akt inhibition decreased AR expression, suggesting that Akt activity was required for regulation of AR protein levels. However, while androgen-independent LNCaP-abl cells also showed diminished AR protein levels in response to Akt inhibition, treatment of androgen-independent LNCaP-AI cells failed to alter AR protein levels upon similar treatment, suggesting that AR protein levels in these androgen-independent prostate cells were regulated by mechanisms independent of Akt activation. Regulation of AR, downstream of activated Akt, also was observed in vivo when examining transgenic mice that overexpress constitutively active mutant myristoylated (myr)-Akt1 in the prostate. Transgenic mice expressing activated myr-Akt1 exhibited higher levels of AR mRNA and protein. Expression of activated myr-Akt1 did not alter prostate cell growth and no significant size differences between prostate tissues derived from transgenic animals were observed when comparing transgenic mice with wild-type mice. Still, transgenic mice overexpressing Akt exhibited higher levels of γH2AX and phosphorylated Chk2 in prostate tissue. These changes in markers associated with oncogene-induced senescence confirmed significant altered signaling in the transgenic mouse model. Overall, results presented here suggest that AR levels are regulated by the Akt pathway.},

	Abstract = {Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) are involved in hormone-refractory growth and poor prognosis of a subgroup of human prostate cancer. In this communication, we investigated the regulation of PSA by the EGFR signaling pathway using LNCaP C-81 prostate cancer cells. Administration of EGF stimulated the growth of LNCaP C-81 cells, however, PSA expression and secretion were suppressed. An EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, abrogated the PSA suppression effect by EGF, in concurrence with the suppression of tyro-phosphorylation levels of EGFR. Interestingly, the AR level was also decreased in EGF-treated LNCaP C-81 cells. Moreover, LY294002, but not PD98059, inhibited the PSA and AR suppression effect by EGF in concurrence with the suppression of phosphorylation levels of Akt. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest the existence of a novel androgen-independent PSA regulatory mechanism, i.e., the EGFR signaling pathway negatively regulates PSA expression which may be induced by the alteration of AR expression via the PI3K-Akt pathway in LNCaP C-81 cells.},

@article{Hendriks2003,
	Abstract = {Endocytic trafficking plays an important role in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. Many cell types express multiple EGFR family members (including EGFR, HER2, HER3, and/or HER4) that interact to form an array of homo- and heterodimers. Differential trafficking of these receptors should strongly affect signaling through this system by changing substrate access and heterodimerization efficiency. Because of the complexity of these dynamic processes, we used a quantitative and computational model to understand their integrated operation. Parameters characterizing EGFR and HER2 interactions were determined using experimental data obtained from mammary epithelial cells constructed to express different levels of HER2, enabling us to estimate receptor-specific internalization rate constants and dimer uncoupling rate constants. Significant novel results obtained from this work are as follows: first, that EGFR homodimerization and EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization occur with comparable affinities; second, that EGFR/HER2 heterodimers traffic as single entities. Furthermore, model predictions of the relationship of HER2 expression levels to consequent distribution of EGFR homodimers and EGFR/HER2 heterodimers suggest that the levels of HER2 found on normal cells are barely at the threshold necessary to drive efficient heterodimerization. Thus, altering HER2 concentrations, either overall or local, could provide an effective mechanism for regulating EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization and may explain why HER2 overexpression found in some cancers has such a profound effect on cell physiology.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enzalutamide (formerly called MDV3100) targets multiple steps in the androgen-receptor-signaling pathway, the major driver of prostate-cancer growth. We aimed to evaluate whether enzalutamide prolongs survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy.
METHODS: In our phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we stratified 1199 men with castration-resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score and pain intensity. We randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive oral enzalutamide at a dose of 160 mg per day (800 patients) or placebo (399 patients). The primary end point was overall survival.
RESULTS: The study was stopped after a planned interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths. The median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.3 to not yet reached) in the enzalutamide group versus 13.6 months (95% CI, 11.3 to 15.8) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death in the enzalutamide group, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.75; P<0.001). The superiority of enzalutamide over placebo was shown with respect to all secondary end points: the proportion of patients with a reduction in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level by 50% or more (54% vs. 2%, P<0.001), the soft-tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, P<0.001), the quality-of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, P<0.001), the time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 3.0 months; hazard ratio, 0.25; P<0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; P<0.001), and the time to the first skeletal-related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; P<0.001). Rates of fatigue, diarrhea, and hot flashes were higher in the enzalutamide group. Seizures were reported in five patients (0.6%) receiving enzalutamide.

	Abstract = {Prostatic epithelial cells and most primary prostate tumors are dependent on androgen for growth, but how androgen regulates cellular proliferation remains unsolved. Using poorly understood mechanisms, recurrent tumor cells evade the androgen requirement. We utilized androgen-dependent prostatic tumor cells to demonstrate that androgen exerts its effect on the cell cycle by influencing specific aspects of G1-S progression. Androgen depletion of these cells results in early G1 arrest, characterized by reduced cyclin-dependent kinase activity, and underphosphorylated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB). The reduction in kinase activity was partially attributed to reduction of specific G1 cyclins and alternate regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Using this information, we developed a reliable assay to assess the ability of specific G1 regulatory proteins to circumvent these controls and promote androgen-independent growth. As expected, inactivation of RB was required for progression through the cell cycle. Surprisingly, overexpression of G1 cyclins, which drives RB phosphorylation, was insufficient to promote androgen-independent cell cycle progression. Introduction of viral oncoproteins did promote G1-S progression in the absence of androgen, dependent on their ability to sequester RB and related proteins. These results provide the first evidence that multiple elements governing the G1-S transition dictate androgen-dependent growth, and the formation of androgen-independent prostatic tumors may be because of misregulation of these processes.},

In prostate cancer patients, the serum PSA level is usually elevated and cancer cells are initially responsive to androgens. However, those cancer cells become androgen-independent after androgen ablation therapy. In hormone-refractory cancer patients, even in an androgen-deprived environment, the circulation level of PSA rebounds and is constitutively elevated through a yet unknown mechanism. Tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 is involved in regulating the androgen-responsive phenotype of prostate cancer cells, and it is at least partly regulated by the cellular form of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a prostate-unique protein tyrosine phosphatase. We investigated the ErbB-2 signal pathway in androgen-independent PSA secretion. LNCaP C-81 cells, which are androgen-independent LNCaP cells lacking endogenous PAcP expression with a hypertyrosine phosphorylated ErbB-2, secreted a higher level of PSA in conditioned media than did androgen-sensitive LNCaP C-33 parental cells. A restored expression of cellular PAcP in C-81 cells was concurrent with a decrease in tyrophosphorylation of ErbB-2 and reduction of PSA secretion. Moreover, transient transfection of C-33 cells with the wild-type ErbB-2 or a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 cDNA resulted in an increased level of secreted PSA. The elevation of secreted PSA level by the forced expression of ErbB-2 was inhibited by an MEK inhibitor, PD98059. In C-81 cells, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of ErbB-2 reduced the secreted level of PSA. The inhibition of ErbB-2 or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by specific inhibitors AG879, AG825, or PD98059 led to a decrease in PSA secretion. Taken together, our data clearly indicate that the ErbB-2 signal pathway via MAP kinases (ERK1/2) is involved in regulating the secretion of PSA by androgen-independent human prostate cancer LNCaP C-81 cells in an androgen-depleted environment.},

	Abstract = {Whereas several apoptosis-related proteins have been linked to the antiapoptotic effects of Akt serine-threonine kinase, the search continues to explain the Akt signaling role in promoting cell survival via antiapoptotic effects. Here, we demonstrate that Akt phosphorylates the androgen receptor (AR) at Ser-210 and Ser-790. A mutation at AR Ser-210 results in the reversal of Akt-mediated suppression of AR transactivation. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt pathway results in the suppression of AR target genes, such as p21, and the decrease of androgen/AR-mediated apoptosis, which may involve the inhibition of interaction between AR and AR coregulators. Together, these findings provide a molecular basis for cross-talk between two signaling pathways at the level of Akt and AR-AR coregulators that may help us to better understand the roles of Akt in the androgen/AR-mediated apoptosis.},

However, the way in which PI3K/Akt controls androgen receptor (AR)-mediated prostate cancer cell growth remains unclear and controversial. Here, we demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates AR activity in a cell passage number-dependent manner. Specifically, PI3K/Akt pathway can suppress AR activity in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells with low passage numbers. In contrast, it can also enhance AR activity in LNCaP cells with high passage numbers. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor-1 can activate the PI3K/Akt pathway that results in the phosphorylation of AR at Ser210 and Ser790. The consequence of these events may then change the stability of AR protein. Together, our results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway may have distinct mechanisms to modulate AR functions in various stages of prostate cancer cells and that a combined therapy of antiandrogens and anti-PI3K/Akt inhibitors may be worth considering as a future therapeutic approach to battle prostate cancer.},

Due to the important role of these two enzymes as prostate epithelium differentiation markers, we investigated their regulation of expression at the mRNA level in LNCaP human prostate carcinoma cells. Interestingly, phenol red, a pH indicator in the culture medium, promoted cell growth. To eliminate this non-specific effect, a phenol red-free, steroid-reduced medium was utilized. When high-density cells were grown in that medium, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) suppressed PAcP but stimulated PSA. However, tumor promoter phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) functioned as a potent inhibitor of both PAcP and PSA expression. Prolonged treatment with DHT as well as TPA resulted in a similar down-regulation of protein kinase C and cellular PAcP activities. Thus, the levels of PAcP and PSA mRNA are differentially regulated by androgens in LNCaP cells.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Understanding cell proliferation regulation in hormone refractory prostate cancer may provide answers for novel solutions. Protein tyrosine phosphatases have been thought to have key roles in regulating cell proliferation and be involved in oncogenesis, although to our knowledge their functional roles in human prostate cancer remain unknown. Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a major phosphatase in prostate epithelium, has been shown to function as a neutral protein tyrosine phosphatase in these cells. We evaluated the biological significance of cellular prostatic acid phosphatase expression in human prostate cancer cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical testing of human prostate cancer archival specimens was done to evaluate the expression of cellular PAcP. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to determine cellular PAcP and SH2 domain-bearing tyrosine phosphatase-1 levels as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2/neu in different human prostate cancer cells. The biological behavior of LNCaP derivative sublines was characterized in vitro and in vivo by soft agar analysis and xenograft animal inoculation.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining of human prostate clearly showed that cellular levels of PAcP significantly decreases in prostate cancer cells (p <0.001). The results of biochemical characterization revealed that the cellular level of PAcP but not SHP-1, another differentiation associated protein tyrosine phosphatase, consistently correlated negatively with the growth of several human prostate cancer cell lines. Reintroducing cellular PAcP activity in prostate cancer cells by PAcP complementary DNA transfection resulted in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of c-ErbB-2/neu, decreased proliferation rates in culture as well as decreased anchorage independent growth in soft agar. The xenograft animal model demonstrated that a higher tumor growth rate as well as larger size is associated with a lower level of cellular PAcP.
CONCLUSIONS: Cellular PAcP can down-regulate prostate cancer cell growth, at least partially by dephosphorylating c-ErbB-2/neu. Therefore, decreased cellular PAcP expression in cancer cells may be involved in prostate cancer progression.},

	Abstract = {Advanced prostate cancer invariably recurs despite androgen deprivation therapy. The androgen receptor (AR) likely plays a key role in this progression and in the continued survival and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in the low androgen environment. Cross-talk with growth factor receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, has been postulated as a potential mechanism to activate AR in recurrent prostate cancer. We have investigated the role of HER-2/neu (ErbB-2) tyrosine kinase in AR function by characterizing the effect of inhibiting endogenous HER-2 activity in LNCaP cells. We used two independent methods, expression of intracellular single-chain antibody against HER-2 and treatment with a novel dual EGFR/HER-2 kinase inhibitor GW572016 (lapatinib). Expression of intracellular HER-2 antibody scFv-5R and treatment with GW572016 inhibited HER-2 signaling. This HER-2 inhibition led to impairment of AR-mediated functions, such as androgen-stimulated growth and the induction of endogenous prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA and protein. Androgen-stimulated recruitment of AR and histone acetylation at the androgen responsive enhancer of the PSA gene, detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, were impaired by HER-2 inhibition. GW572016 was more potent in its ability to inhibit PSA expression and AR recruitment and histone acetylation than the EGFR-selective kinase inhibitor ZD1839 (gefitinib), consistent with the HER-2 kinase playing the major role in AR regulation. These results show that HER-2 signaling is required for optimal transcriptional activity of AR in prostate cancer cells and suggest that HER-2 inhibition may provide a novel strategy to disrupt AR function in prostate cancer.},

	Abstract = {Steroid hormones play key roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation in targeting tissues. However, in advanced cancers, the steroid hormone regulation is frequently attenuated through a yet unknown mechanism even in the presence of functional steroid hormone receptors. We investigate the functional role of tyrosine phosphorylation signaling in the hormone-refractory growth of human prostate tumors. Initial studies demonstrate that the androgen-responsive phenotype of human prostate cancer cells associates with a low phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) level of ErbB-2, which is regulated by cellular prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a protein tyrosine phosphatase. In prostate cancer cells, the p-Tyr level, but not the protein level, of ErbB-2 inversely correlates with the androgen-responsiveness of cell proliferation. Androgen-stimulated cell growth concurs with a down-regulation of cellular PAcP, an elevated p-Tyr level of ErbB-2, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, only the ErbB-2 inhibitor AG 879, but not the EGFR inhibitor AG 1478, abolishes androgen-induced cell proliferation. Forced expression of ErbB-2 can also attenuate androgen promotion of cell growth. Data taken collectively conclude that in human prostate cancer cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB-2 regulated by cellular PAcP plays a key role in regulating androgen-mediated proliferation signaling.

	Abstract = {The mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PCa) cells progress to a hormone refractory state are poorly understood. The progression process under androgen ablation conditions involves the survival of at least a portion of malignant cells and their eventual proliferation in an androgen-independent manner. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of PI3K signaling in such a progression. Using an in vitro model of androgen ablation, we show that after removal of androgen support, the human PCa cell line LNCaP initially arrested in G(1) and trans-differentiated into neuroendocrine-like cells that eventually resumed androgen-independent proliferation. Both acute and chronic androgen ablation resulted in an increase in basal levels of PI3K and Akt activity, which were sustained throughout the progression process. Under these conditions, inhibition of PI3K, pharmacologically or with ectopic expression of PTEN, arrested cell proliferation and blocked progression to the androgen-independent state. In contrast, LNCaP cells in the presence of androgens were marginally sensitive to PI3K inhibition. During the chronic stage of androgen deprivation, androgen-independent proliferation correlated with diminished p27(kip1) protein levels, whereas PI3K and Akt activity remained elevated. At this stage, PI3K inhibition rapidly triggered accumulation of p27(kip1), cell cycle arrest, and cell death. PI3K modulated p27(kip1) levels at least in part by regulating its rate of degradation. Taken together, these data show that androgen ablation alone can increase PI3K-Akt activation, which supports survival after acute androgen ablation and proliferation during chronic androgen deprivation. Successful progression to the androgen-independent state in the LNCaP cell line model requires intact PI3K signaling.},

If cycloheximide is later removed from the culture medium, treated cells will return to the division cycle, showing a complex pattern of division times post-treatment, as first measured by Zetterberg and colleagues. We simulate these physiological responses of mammalian cells to transient inhibition of growth, using a set of nonlinear differential equations based on a realistic model of the molecular events underlying progression through the cell cycle. The model relies on our earlier work on the regulation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases during the cell division cycle of yeast.

	Abstract = {Human cyclin D1 is expressed as two isoforms derived by alternate RNA splicing, termed D1a and D1b, which differ for the inclusion of intron 4 in the D1b mRNA. Both isoforms are frequently upregulated in human cancers, but cyclin D1b displays relatively higher oncogenic potential. The splicing factors that regulate alternative splicing of cyclin D1b remain unknown despite the likelihood that they contribute to cyclin D1 oncogenicity. In this study, we report that Sam68, an RNA-binding protein frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, enhances splicing of cyclin D1b and supports its expression in prostate cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Sam68 is recruited to the human CCND1 gene encoding cyclin D1 and that it binds to cyclin D1 mRNA. Transient overexpression and RNAi knockdown experiments indicated that Sam68 acts to enhance endogenous expression of cyclin D1b. Minigene reporter assays showed that Sam68 directly affected alternative splicing of CCND1 message, with a preference for the A870 allele that is known to favor cyclin D1b splicing. Sam68 interacted with the proximal region of intron 4, and its binding correlated inversely with recruitment of the spliceosomal component U1-70K. Sam68-mediated splicing was modulated by signal transduction pathways that elicit phosphorylation of Sam68 and regulate its affinity for CCND1 intron 4. Notably, Sam68 expression positively correlates with levels of cyclin D1b, but not D1a, in human prostate carcinomas. Our results identify Sam68 as the first splicing factor to affect CCND1 alternative splicing in prostate cancer cells, and suggest that increased levels of Sam68 may stimulate cyclin D1b expression in human prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human prostate carcinoma cell line, LNCaP, proliferates under stimulation by a limited number of mitogenic signals, which include members of the growth factor and steroid hormone families. Androgens and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are among the LNCaP cell mitogens. We tested the hypothesis that these mitogens stimulate LNCaP cell proliferation at least in part through the induction of cyclin D1, a protein requisite for cell cycle progression, which is expressed in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.
METHODS: LNCaP cells were grown in serum-free medium with 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml EGF, 0.1 nM or 1.0 nM mibolerone (a potent androgen agonist), or vehicle (distilled water or 0.01% ethanol). Expression of cyclin D, mRNA, and protein were assessed by Northern and Western blot analyses. Transcription regulation was assessed by nuclear runoff assay.
RESULTS: Western analyses demonstrated that EGF stimulated cyclin D1 protein expression 4-fold over 12 hr. Northern analyses showed a 4-fold increase in mRNA expression, peaking within 4 hr of EGF stimulation. There were no effects on cyclin D1 protein or mRNA expression with mibolerone treatments. We further explored the mechanism of cyclin D1 induction. LNCaP cells stimulated for 1 hr with EGF demonstrated a 2-fold increase in cyclin D1 message, as assayed by nuclear runoff transcription assay. In addition, we demonstrated the involvement of the protein kinase C pathway in mediating the EGF induction of cyclin D1.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that one of the mechanisms by which growth factors such as EGF may stimulate prostate cell proliferation is through the direct induction of cyclin proteins, which are necessary for entry of cells into mitosis.},

The EGF-induced increase in AR transcriptional activity is dependent on phosphorylation at mitogen-activated protein kinase consensus site Ser-515 in the AR NH(2)-terminal region and at protein kinase C consensus site Ser-578 in the AR DNA binding domain. Phosphorylation at these sites alters the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of AR and AR interaction with the Ku-70/80 regulatory subunits of DNA-dependent protein kinase. Abolishing AR Ser-578 phosphorylation by introducing an S578A mutation eliminates the AR transcriptional response to EGF and increases both AR binding of Ku-70/80 and nuclear retention of AR in association with hyperphosphorylation of AR Ser-515. The results support a model in which AR transcriptional activity increases castration-recurrent prostate cancer cell growth in response to EGF by site-specific serine phosphorylation that regulates nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling through interactions with the Ku-70/80 regulatory complex.},

	Abstract = {SHP-1, a haematopoietic cell-specific tyrosine phosphatase, is also expressed in human prostate. In this study, we report that SHP-1 depletion in PC-3 cells induced by small interfering RNAs causes G1 phase cell-cycle arrest accompanied by changes in some components of the cell-cycle machinery. SHP-1 knockdown increases p27(Kip1) (p27) protein stability, its nuclear localization and p27 gene transcription. These effects could be mediated by PI3K-AKT pathway as SHP-1 interacts with PI3K regulating its activity and p110 catalytic subunit phosphorylation. The increase in p27 protein stability could also because of reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) activity. SHP-1 knockdown decreases the CDK6 levels, inducing retinoblastoma protein hypophosphorylation, downregulation of cyclin E and thereby a decrease in the CDK2 activity. However, the codepletion of SHP-1 and p27 does not produce re-entry into the cycle, implying that p27 is not required to maintain cell-cycle arrest induced by SHP-1 depletion. The maintenance of the PC-3 cell anti-proliferative response after p27 loss could be because of mislocalization of CDK2 induced by SHP-1 knockdown. This study shows that SHP-1 depletion promotes cell-cycle arrest by modulating the activity of cell-cycle regulators and suggests that SHP-1 may be required for the proper functioning of events governing cell-cycle progression.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To update eligibility and outcome measures in trials that evaluate systemic treatment for patients with progressive prostate cancer and castrate levels of testosterone.
METHODS: A committee of investigators experienced in conducting trials for prostate cancer defined new consensus criteria by reviewing previous criteria, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and emerging trial data.
RESULTS: The Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) recommends a two-objective paradigm: (1) controlling, relieving, or eliminating disease manifestations that are present when treatment is initiated and (2) preventing or delaying disease manifestations expected to occur. Prostate cancers progressing despite castrate levels of testosterone are considered castration resistant and not hormone refractory. Eligibility is defined using standard disease assessments to authenticate disease progression, prior treatment, distinct clinical subtypes, and predictive models. Outcomes are reported independently for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), imaging, and clinical measures, avoiding grouped categorizations such as complete or partial response. In most trials, early changes in PSA and/or pain are not acted on without other evidence of disease progression, and treatment should be continued for at least 12 weeks to ensure adequate drug exposure. Bone scans are reported as "new lesions" or "no new lesions," changes in soft-tissue disease assessed by RECIST, and pain using validated scales. Defining eligibility for prevent/delay end points requires attention to estimated event frequency and/or random assignment to a control group.
CONCLUSION: PCWG2 recommends increasing emphasis on time-to-event end points (ie, failure to progress) as decision aids in proceeding from phase II to phase III trials. Recommendations will evolve as data are generated on the utility of intermediate end points to predict clinical benefit.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors. In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the model provided insight into the importance of network components as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together, the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways. Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {p66(Shc), an isoform of Shc adaptor proteins, is shown to mediate various signals, including cellular stress. However, little is known about its involvement in carcinogenesis. We previously showed that p66(Shc) protein level is upregulated by steroid hormones in human carcinoma cells and is higher in prostate cancer (PCa) specimens than adjacent noncancerous cells. In this study, we investigated the role of p66(Shc) protein in PCa cell proliferation. Among different PCa cell lines tested, p66(Shc) protein level showed positive correlation with cell proliferation, that is, rapid-growing cells expressed higher p66(Shc) protein than slow-growing cells. Exposure of slow-growing LNCaP C-33 cells to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) led to upregulation of proliferation and p66(Shc) protein level. Conversely, growth suppression of fast-growing cells by cellular form of prostatic acid phosphatase (cPAcP) expression, a negative growth regulator, down-regulated their p66(Shc) protein level. Additionally, increased expression of p66(Shc) protein by cDNA transfection in LNCaP C-33 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation. Cell cycle analyses showed higher percentage of p66(Shc)-overexpressing cells at S phase (24%) than control cells (17%), correlating with their growth rates. On the other hand, transient knock-down of p66(Shc) expression by RNAi in rapidly growing cells decreased their proliferation as evidenced by the reduced cell growth as well as S phase in p66(Shc)-knocked down cells. The p66(Shc) signaling in cell growth regulation is apparently mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK). Thus, our results indicate a novel role for p66(Shc) in prostate carcinogenesis, in part, promoting cell proliferation.},

	Abstract = {Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) was used as a valuable surrogate marker for monitoring prostate cancer prior to the availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Even though the level of PAcP is increased in the circulation of prostate cancer patients, its intracellular level and activity are greatly diminished in prostate cancer cells. Recent advances in understanding the function of the cellular form of PAcP (cPAcP) have shed some light on its role in prostate carcinogenesis, which may have potential applications for prostate cancer therapy. It is now evident that cPAcP functions as a neutral protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) in prostate cancer cells and dephosphorylates HER-2/ErbB-2/Neu (HER-2: human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) at the phosphotyrosine (p-Tyr) residues. Dephosphorylation of HER-2 at its p-Tyr residues results in the down-regulation of its specific activity, which leads to decreases in growth and tumorigenicity of those cancer cells. Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression correlates with hyperphosphorylation of HER-2 at tyrosine residues and activation of downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, which results in prostate cancer progression as well as androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. These in vitro results on the effect of cPAcP on androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells corroborate the clinical findings that cPAcP level is greatly decreased in advanced prostate cancer and provide insights into one of the molecular mechanisms involved in prostate cancer progression. Results from experiments using xenograft animal models further indicate a novel role of cPAcP as a tumor suppressor. Future studies are warranted to clarify the use of cPAcP as a therapeutic agent in human prostate cancer patients.},

	Abstract = {When prostate cancer is first detected it generally is dependent on the presence of androgens for growth, and responds to androgen ablation therapies. However, the disease often recurs in a disseminated and apparently androgen independent (AI) form, and in this state is almost invariably fatal. Considerable evidence indicates that the Androgen receptor (AR) continues to be required even in androgen independent (AI) disease. Thus, a key to understanding hormone independent prostate cancer is to determine the mechanism(s) by which the AR can function even in the absence of physiologic levels of androgen. In this article, we argue that growth factors and receptors that utilize Ras family members drive prostate cancer progression to a state of androgen hypersensitivity; and that post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylations) of transcriptional cofactors might be responsible for modulating the function of the AR so that it is active even at low concentrations of androgen.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if sorafenib is associated with a 4-month probability of progression-free survival, which is consistent with 50%, as determined by clinical, radiographic, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with progressive metastatic AIPC were enrolled in an open-label, single-arm phase II study. Sorafenib was given continuously at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. Clinical assessment and PSA measurement were done every cycle whereas radiographic measurements were carried out every two cycles.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study to date, completing a planned first stage of the trial. Baseline patient characteristics included a median age of 63.9 years (range, 50-77 years), Gleason score of 9 (range, 4-9.5), and PSA concentration of 53.3 ng/mL (range, 2-1,905 ng/mL). Fifty-nine percent of patients had received one prior chemotherapy regimen. Of the 21 patients with progressive disease, 13 progressed only by PSA criteria in the absence of evidence of clinical and radiographic progression. Two patients were found to have dramatic reduction of bone metastatic lesions as shown by bone scan, although they met PSA progression criteria at the time when scans were obtained. Toxicities likely related to treatment included one grade 3 hypertension; one grade 3 hand-foot syndrome; and grade 1/2 toxicities: fatigue, anorexia, hypertension, skin rash, nausea, and diarrhea. Results from in vitro studies suggested that PSA is not a good marker of sorafenib activity. The geometric mean exposure (AUC(0-12)) and maximum concentration (C(max)) were 9.76 h mg/L and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. The time to maximum concentration (t(max)) and accumulation ratio (after second dose) ranged from 2 to 12 h and 0.68 to 6.43, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is relatively well tolerated in AIPC with two patients showing evidence of improved bony metastatic lesions. Interpretation of this study is complicated by discordant radiographic and PSA responses. PSA may not be an adequate biomarker for monitoring sorafenib activity. Based on these observations, further investigation using only clinical and radiographic end points as progression criteria is warranted. Accrual to the second stage of trial is ongoing.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) plays a central role in prostate cancer, with most tumors responding to androgen deprivation therapies, but the molecular basis for this androgen dependence has not been determined. Androgen [5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] stimulation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, which have constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway activation due to PTEN loss, caused increased expression of cyclin D1, D2, and D3 proteins, retinoblastoma protein hyperphosphorylation, and cell cycle progression. However, cyclin D1 and D2 message levels were unchanged, indicating that the increases in cyclin D proteins were mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. This mechanism was identified as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation. DHT treatment increased mTOR activity as assessed by phosphorylation of the downstream targets p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1, and mTOR inhibition with rapamycin blocked the DHT-stimulated increase in cyclin D proteins. Significantly, DHT stimulation of mTOR was not mediated through activation of the PI3K/Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase pathways and subsequent tuberous sclerosis complex 2/tuberin inactivation or by suppression of AMP-activated protein kinase. In contrast, mTOR activation by DHT was dependent on AR-stimulated mRNA synthesis. Oligonucleotide microarrays showed that DHT-stimulated rapid increases in multiple genes that regulate nutrient availability, including transporters for amino acids and other organic ions. These results indicate that a critical function of AR in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells is to support the pathologic activation of mTOR, possibly by increasing the expression of proteins that enhance nutrient availability and thereby prevent feedback inhibition of mTOR.},

@article{Yamamoto2000,
	Abstract = {Androgens play an important role in the growth of prostate cancer, but the molecular mechanism that underlies development of resistance to antiandrogen therapy remains unknown. Cyclin E has now been shown to increase the transactivation activity of the human androgen receptor (AR) in the presence of its ligand dihydrotestosterone. The enhancement of AR activity by cyclin E was resistant to inhibition by the antiandrogen 5-hydroxyflutamide. Cyclin E was shown to bind directly to the COOH terminus portion of the AB domain of the AR, and to enhance its AF-1 transactivation function. These results suggest that cyclin E functions as a coactivator of the AR, and that aberrant expression of cyclin E in tumors may contribute to persistent activation of AR function, even during androgen ablation therapy.},

@article{Yeh1999,
	Abstract = {Overexpression of the HER2/Neu protooncogene has been linked to the progression of breast cancer. Here we demonstrate that the growth of prostate cancer LNCaP cells can also be increased by the stable transfection of HER2/Neu. Using AG879, a HER2/Neu inhibitor, and PD98059, a MAP kinase inhibitor, as well as MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MPK-1), in the transfection assay, we found that HER2/Neu could induce prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a marker for the progression of prostate cancer, through the MAP kinase pathway at a low androgen level. Reporter assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays further suggest this HER2/Neu-induced androgen receptor (AR) transactivation may function through the promotion of interaction between AR and AR coactivators, such as ARA70. Furthermore, we found this HER2/Neu --> MAP kinase --> AR-ARAs --> PSA pathway could not be blocked completely by hydroxyflutamide, an antiandrogen used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Together, these data provide a novel pathway from HER2/Neu to AR transactivation, and they may represent one of the reasons for the PSA re-elevation and hormone resistance during androgen ablation therapy in prostate cancer patients.},

@article{Yuan2007,
	Abstract = {Aberrant regulation in the adhesive ability of cancer cells is closely associated with their metastatic activity. In this study, we examine the role of ErbB-2 in regulating the adhesive ability of androgen receptor (AR)-positive human prostate cancer (PCa) cells, the major cell population of PCa. Utilizing different LNCaP and MDA PCa2b cells as model systems, we found that ErbB-2 activity was correlated with PYK2 activity and adhesive ability in those cells. Increased ErbB-2 expression or activity in LNCaP C-33 cells enhanced PYK2 activation and cell adhesion, while the high PYK2 activity and the rapid adhesion of LNCaP C-81 cells were decreased by diminishing ErbB-2 expression or activity. Knockdown studies revealed the predominant role of ErbB-2 in regulating LNCaP C-81 cell adhesion. Coimmunoprecipitation showed that C-81 cells had increased interaction between ErbB-2 and PYK2. Elevated ErbB-2 activity in LNCaP cells correlated with increased ERK/MAPK activity and enhanced adhesive ability, which were abolished by the expression of K457A-PYK2 mutant or the treatment of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. In summary, our data suggested that ErbB-2, via PYK2-ERK/MAPK, upregulates the adhesive ability of AR-positive human PCa cells.},
