	Abstract = {Systems analysis of metabolic and growth functions in microbial organisms is rapidly developing and maturing. Such studies are enabled by reconstruction, at the genomic scale, of the biochemical reaction networks that underlie cellular processes. The network reconstruction process is organism specific and is based on an annotated genome sequence, high-throughput network-wide data sets and bibliomic data on the detailed properties of individual network components. Here we describe the process that is currently used to achieve comprehensive network reconstructions and discuss how these reconstructions are curated and validated. This review should aid the growing number of researchers who are carrying out reconstructions for particular target organisms.},

	Abstract = {Reconstructed microbial metabolic networks facilitate a mechanistic description of the genotype-phenotype relationship through the deployment of constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) methods. As reconstructed networks leverage genomic data for insight and phenotype prediction, the development of COBRA methods has accelerated following the advent of whole-genome sequencing. Here, we describe a phylogeny of COBRA methods that has rapidly evolved from the few early methods, such as flux balance analysis and elementary flux mode analysis, into a repertoire of more than 100 methods. These methods have enabled genome-scale analysis of microbial metabolism for numerous basic and applied uses, including antibiotic discovery, metabolic engineering and modelling of microbial community behaviour.},

Based entirely on information procured from batch growth on single substrates, the models accurately predict without further parameter fitting, diauxic growth on mixed substrates, automatically predicting the order in which the substrates are consumed. Even triauxic growth on a mixture of glucose, xylose, and lactose is predicted by the model based on single substrate data. Growth on glucose-fructose mixtures appears to need a slightly modified strategy for cybernetic variables.},

This has spurred the development of a wide array of computational tools, and in particular, mathematical optimization approaches, to assist in fundamental metabolic network analyses and redesign efforts. This review highlights a number of optimization-based frameworks developed towards addressing challenges in the analysis and engineering of metabolic networks. In particular, three major types of studies are covered here including exploring model predictions, correction and improvement of models of metabolism, and redesign of metabolic networks for the targeted overproduction of a desired compound. Overall, the methods reviewed in this paper highlight the diversity of queries, breadth of questions and complexity of redesigns that are amenable to mathematical optimization strategies.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade a massive amount of research has been dedicated to generating omics data to gain insight into a variety of biological phenomena, including cancer, obesity, biofuel production, and infection. Although most of these omics data are available publicly, there is a growing concern that much of these data sit in databases without being used or fully analyzed. Statistical inference methods have been widely applied to gain insight into which genes may influence the activities of others in a given omics data set, however, they do not provide information on the underlying mechanisms or whether the interactions are direct or distal. Biochemically, genetically, and genomically consistent knowledge bases are increasingly being used to extract deeper biological knowledge and understanding from these data sets than possible by inferential methods. This improvement is largely due to knowledge bases providing a validated biological context for interpreting the data.},

	Abstract = {The genome-scale model (GEM) of metabolism in the bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 has been in development for over a decade and is now in wide use. GEM-enabled studies of E. coli have been primarily focused on six applications: (1) metabolic engineering, (2) model-driven discovery, (3) prediction of cellular phenotypes, (4) analysis of biological network properties, (5) studies of evolutionary processes, and (6) models of interspecies interactions. In this review, we provide an overview of these applications along with a critical assessment of their successes and limitations, and a perspective on likely future developments in the field. Taken together, the studies performed over the past decade have established a genome-scale mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships in E. coli metabolism that forms the basis for similar efforts for other microbial species. Future challenges include the expansion of GEMs by integrating additional cellular processes beyond metabolism, the identification of key constraints based on emerging data types, and the development of computational methods able to handle such large-scale network models with sufficient accuracy.},

	Abstract = {To which extent can optimality principles describe the operation of metabolic networks? By explicitly considering experimental errors and in silico alternate optima in flux balance analysis, we systematically evaluate the capacity of 11 objective functions combined with eight adjustable constraints to predict (13)C-determined in vivo fluxes in Escherichia coli under six environmental conditions. While no single objective describes the flux states under all conditions, we identified two sets of objectives for biologically meaningful predictions without the need for further, potentially artificial constraints. Unlimited growth on glucose in oxygen or nitrate respiring batch cultures is best described by nonlinear maximization of the ATP yield per flux unit. Under nutrient scarcity in continuous cultures, in contrast, linear maximization of the overall ATP or biomass yields achieved the highest predictive accuracy. Since these particular objectives predict the system behavior without preconditioning of the network structure, the identified optimality principles reflect, to some extent, the evolutionary selection of metabolic network regulation that realizes the various flux states.},

	Abstract = {Annotated genome sequences can be used to reconstruct whole-cell metabolic networks. These metabolic networks can be modelled and analysed (computed) to study complex biological functions. In particular, constraints-based in silico models have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates, and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus, incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure, the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days, or about 700 generations, from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.},

Moreover, through in silico comparative transcriptomics, the model allows the discovery of new regulons and improving the genome and transcription unit annotations.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate strong experimental support for the cybernetic model based on maximizing carbon uptake rate in describing the microorganism's regulatory behavior by verifying exacting predictions of steady state multiplicity in a chemostat. Experiments with a feed mixture of glucose and pyruvate show multiple steady state behavior as predicted by the cybernetic model. When multiplicity occurs at a dilution (growth) rate, it results in hysteretic behavior following switches in dilution rate from above and below. This phenomenon is caused by transient paths leading to different steady states through dynamic maximization of the carbon uptake rate. Thus steady state multiplicity is a manifestation of the nonlinearity arising from cybernetic mechanisms rather than of the nonlinear kinetics. The predicted metabolic multiplicity would extend to intracellular states such as enzyme levels and fluxes to be verified in future experiments.},

	Abstract = {The Escherichia coli MG1655 genome has been completely sequenced. The annotated sequence, biochemical information, and other information were used to reconstruct the E. coli metabolic map. The stoichiometric coefficients for each metabolic enzyme in the E. coli metabolic map were assembled to construct a genome-specific stoichiometric matrix. The E. coli stoichiometric matrix was used to define the system's characteristics and the capabilities of E. coli metabolism. The effects of gene deletions in the central metabolic pathways on the ability of the in silico metabolic network to support growth were assessed, and the in silico predictions were compared with experimental observations. It was shown that based on stoichiometric and capacity constraints the in silico analysis was able to qualitatively predict the growth potential of mutant strains in 86% of the cases examined. Herein, it is demonstrated that the synthesis of in silico metabolic genotypes based on genomic, biochemical, and strain-specific information is possible, and that systems analysis methods are available to analyze and interpret the metabolic phenotype.},

	Abstract = {Using the modular cybernetic framework developed by Varner and Ramkrishna (Varner and Ramkrishna; 1998a, b) a cybernetic model is formulated that describes the time evolution of the aspartate family of amino acids in Corynebacterium lactofermentum ATCC 21799. The network model formulation is employed in the role of a diagnostic tool for the overproduction of threonine. More precisely, having determined a parameter set that describes the time evolution of a base strain (lysine producer), the model predicted response to genetic perturbations, designed to enhance the level of threonine, are simulated using an appropriately modified cybernetic model and compared with the experimental results of Stephanopoulos and Sinskey (Col{\'o}n et al., 1995a, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61, 74-78) for identical genetic perturbations. It is found that the model predicted response to enzymatic over-expression in the aspartate pathway agrees, for the most part, with experimental observations within the experimental error bounds. This result lends credence to the hypothesis that cybernetic models can be employed to predict the local response of a metabolic network to genetic perturbation, thereby, affording cognizance of the potential pitfalls of a particular genetic alteration strategy a priori.},

	Abstract = {The advent of thousands of annotated genomes, detailed metabolic reconstructions and databases within the flourishing field of systems biology necessitates the development of functionally complete computer models of whole cells and cellular systems. Such models would realistically describe fundamental properties of living systems such as growth, division and chromosome replication. This will inevitably bridge bioinformatic technologies with ongoing mathematical modelling efforts and would allow for in silico prediction of important dynamic physiological events. To demonstrate a potential for the anticipated merger of bioinformatic genome-wide data with a whole-cell computer model, the authors present here an updated version of a dynamic model of Escherichia coli, including a module that correctly describes the initiation and control of DNA replication by nucleoprotein DnaA-ATP molecules. Specifically, a rigorous mathematical approach used to explicitly include the genome-wide distribution of DnaA-binding sites on the replicating chromosome into a computer model of a bacterial cell is discussed. A new simple deterministic approximation of the complex stochastic process of DNA replication initiation is also provided. It is shown for the first time that reasonable assumptions about the mechanism of DNA replication initiation can be implemented in a deterministic whole-cell model to make predictions about the timing of chromosome replication. Furthermore, it is proposed that a large increase in the concentration of DnaA-binding boxes will result in a decreased steady-state growth rate in E. coli.},

@article{2004_castellanos_shuler_PNAS,
	Abstract = {A more complete understanding of the relationship of cell physiology to genomic structure is desirable. Because of the intrinsic complexity of biological organisms, only the simplest cells will allow complete definition of all components and their interactions. The theoretical and experimental construction of a minimal cell has been suggested as a tool to develop such an understanding. Our ultimate goal is to convert a "coarse-grain" lumped parameter computer model of Escherichia coli into a genetically and chemically detailed model of a "minimal cell." The base E. coli model has been converted into a generalized model of a heterotrophic bacterium. This coarse-grain minimal cell model is functionally complete, with growth rate, composition, division, and changes in cell morphology as natural outputs from dynamic simulations where only the initial composition of the cell and of the medium are specified. A coarse-grain model uses pseudochemical species (or modules) that are aggregates of distinct chemical species that share similar chemistry and metabolic dynamics. This model provides a framework in which these modules can be "delumped" into chemical and genetic descriptions while maintaining connectivity to all other functional elements. Here we demonstrate that a detailed description of nucleotide precursors transport and metabolism is successfully integrated into the whole-cell model. This nucleotide submodel requires fewer (12) genes than other theoretical predictions in minimal cells. The demonstration of modularity suggests the possibility of developing modules in parallel and recombining them into a fully functional chemically and genetically detailed model of a prokaryote cell.},

	Abstract = {A computer model is described which is capable of predicting changes in cell composition, cell size, cell shape, and the timing of chromosome synthesis in response to changes in external glucose limitation. The model is constructed primarily from information on unrestricted growth in glucose minimal medium. The ability of the model to make reasonable quantitative predictions under glucose-limitation is a test of the plausibility of the basic biochemical mechanisms included in the model. Such a model should be of use in differentiating among competing hypotheses for biological mechanisms and in suggesting as yet unobserved phenomena. The last two points are illustrated with the testing of a mechanism for the control of the initiation of DNA synthesis and predictions on cellwidth variations during the division cycle.},

@article{Morris:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},
