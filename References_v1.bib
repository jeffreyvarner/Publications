	Abstract = {Predictive understanding of cell signaling network operation based on general prior knowledge but consistent with empirical data in a specific environmental context is a current challenge in computational biology. Recent work has demonstrated that Boolean logic can be used to create context-specific network models by training proteomic pathway maps to dedicated biochemical data; however, the Boolean formalism is restricted to characterizing protein species as either fully active or inactive. To advance beyond this limitation, we propose a novel form of fuzzy logic sufficiently flexible to model quantitative data but also sufficiently simple to efficiently construct models by training pathway maps on dedicated experimental measurements. Our new approach, termed constrained fuzzy logic (cFL), converts a prior knowledge network (obtained from literature or interactome databases) into a computable model that describes graded values of protein activation across multiple pathways. We train a cFL-converted network to experimental data describing hepatocytic protein activation by inflammatory cytokines and demonstrate the application of the resultant trained models for three important purposes: (a) generating experimentally testable biological hypotheses concerning pathway crosstalk, (b) establishing capability for quantitative prediction of protein activity, and (c) prediction and understanding of the cytokine release phenotypic response. Our methodology systematically and quantitatively trains a protein pathway map summarizing curated literature to context-specific biochemical data. This process generates a computable model yielding successful prediction of new test data and offering biological insight into complex datasets that are difficult to fully analyze by intuition alone.},

@article{Cirit:2012kx,
	Abstract = {Signal transduction networks in mammalian cells, comprising a limited set of interacting biochemical pathways, are accessed by various growth factor and cytokine receptors to elicit distinct cell responses. This raises the question as to how specificity of the stimulus-response relationship is encoded at the molecular level. It has been proposed that specificity arises not only from the activation of unique signalling pathways, but also from quantitative differences in the activation and regulation of shared receptor-proximal signalling proteins. To address such hypotheses, data sets with greater precision and coverage of experimental conditions will need to be acquired, and rigorous frameworks that codify and parameterize the inherently non-linear relationships among signalling activities will need to be developed. In the present study we apply a systematic approach combining quantitative measurements and mathematical modelling to compare the signalling networks accessed by FGF (fibroblast growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) receptors in mouse fibroblasts, in which the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) cascade is activated by Ras- and PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-dependent pathways. We show that, whereas the FGF stimulation of PI3K signalling is relatively weak, this deficiency is compensated for by a more potent Ras-dependent activation of ERK. Thus, as the modelling would predict, the ERK pathway is activated to a greater extent in cells co-stimulated with FGF and PDGF, relative to the saturated levels achieved with either ligand alone. It is envisaged that similar approaches will prove valuable in the elucidation of quantitative differences among other closely related receptor signalling networks.},

@article{Butenas:1999aa,
	Abstract = {We have investigated the influence of alterations in plasma coagulation factor levels between 50% and 150% of their mean values for prothrombin, factor X, factor XI, factor IX, factor VII, factor VIII, factor V, protein C, protein S, antithrombin III (AT-III), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as well as combinations of extremes, eg, 50% anticoagulants and 150% procoagulants or 50% procoagulants and 150% anticoagulants in a synthetic "plasma" system. The reaction systems were constructed in vitro using purified, natural, and recombinant proteins and synthetic phospholipid vesicles or platelets with the reactions initiated by recombinant tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa complex (5 pmol/L). To investigate the influence of the protein C system, soluble thrombomodulin (Tm) was also added to the reaction mixture. For the most extreme situations in which the essential plasma procoagulants (prothrombin, and factors X, IX, V, and VIII) and the stoichiometric anticoagulants (AT-III and TFPI) were collectively and inversely altered by 50%, a 28-fold difference in the total available thrombin generated was observed. Variations of most of these proteins 50% above and below the "normal" range, with the remainder at 100%, had only modest influences on the peak and total levels of thrombin generated. The dominant factors influencing thrombin generation were prothrombin and AT-III. When these 2 components were held at 100% and all other plasma procoagulants were reduced to 50%, there was a 60% reduction in the available thrombin generated. No increase in the thrombin generated was observed when the 150% level of all plasma procoagulants other than prothrombin was evaluated. When only prothrombin was raised to 150%, and all other factors were maintained at 100%, the thrombin generated increased by 71% to 121%. When AT-III was at 50% and all other constituents were at 100%, thrombin production was increased by 104% to 196%. The additions of protein C and protein S over the 50% to 150% ranges with Tm at 0.1 nmol/L concentration had limited influence on thrombin generation. Individual variations in factors VII, XI, and X concentrations had little effect on the duration of the initiation phase, the peak thrombin level achieved, or the available thrombin generated. Paradoxically, increases in factor IX concentration to 150% led to lowered thrombin generation, while decreases to 50% led to enhanced thrombin generation, most likely a consequence of factor IX as a competitive substrate with factor X for factor VIIa-TF. Reductions in factor V or factor VIII concentration led to prolongations of the initiation phase, while the reduction of TFPI to 50% led to shortening of this phase. However, none of these alterations led to significant changes in the available thrombin generated. Based on these data, one might surmise that increases in prothrombin and reductions in AT-III, within the normal range, would be potential risk factors for thrombosis and that algorithms that combine normal factor levels may be required to develop predictive tests for thrombosis.},

	Abstract = {The microscopically complicated real world exhibits behavior that often yields to simple yet quantitatively accurate descriptions. Predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in microscopic parameters, both in physics and in multiparameter models in other areas of science. We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion) and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.},

@article{2012_choi_cho_SciSig,
	Abstract = {The protein p53 functions as a tumor suppressor and can trigger either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We used Boolean network modeling and attractor landscape analysis to analyze the state transition dynamics of a simplified p53 network for which particular combinations of activation states of the molecules corresponded to specific cellular outcomes. Our results identified five critical interactions in the network that determined the cellular response to DNA damage, and simulations lacking any of these interactions produced states associated with sustained p53 activity, which corresponded to a cell death response. Attractor landscape analysis of the cellular response to DNA damage of the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the effect of the Mdm2 (murine double minute 2) inhibitor nutlin-3 indicated that nutlin-3 would exhibit limited efficacy in triggering cell death, because the cell death state was not induced to a large extent by simulations with nutlin-3 and instead produced a state consistent with oscillatory p53 dynamics and cell cycle arrest. Attractor landscape analysis also suggested that combining nutlin-3 with inhibition of Wip1 would synergize to stimulate a sustained increase in p53 activity and promote p53-mediated cell death. We validated this synergistic effect in stimulating p53 activity and triggering cell death with single-cell imaging of a fluorescent p53 reporter in MCF7 cells. Thus, attractor landscape analysis of p53 network dynamics and its regulation can identify potential therapeutic strategies for treating cancer.},

	Abstract = {Cells employ highly dynamic signaling networks to drive biological decision processes. Perturbations to these signaling networks may attract cells to new malignant signaling and phenotypic states, termed cancer network attractors, that result in cancer development. As different cancer cells reach these malignant states by accumulating different molecular alterations, uncovering these mechanisms represents a grand challenge in cancer biology. Addressing this challenge will require new systems-based strategies that capture the intrinsic properties of cancer signaling networks and provide deeper understanding of the processes by which genetic lesions perturb these networks and lead to disease phenotypes. Network biology will help circumvent fundamental obstacles in cancer treatment, such as drug resistance and metastasis, empowering personalized and tumor-specific cancer therapies.},

@article{2011_hasenauer_allgower_BMCBioinfo,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of the intracellular pathways within a "typical cell". However, in many biologically important situations even clonal cell populations can show a heterogeneous response. These situations require study of cell-to-cell variability and the development of models for heterogeneous cell populations.
RESULTS: In this paper we consider cell populations in which the dynamics of every single cell is captured by a parameter dependent differential equation. Differences among cells are modeled by differences in parameters which are subject to a probability density. A novel Bayesian approach is presented to infer this probability density from population snapshot data, such as flow cytometric analysis, which do not provide single cell time series data. The presented approach can deal with sparse and noisy measurement data. Furthermore, it is appealing from an application point of view as in contrast to other methods the uncertainty of the resulting parameter distribution can directly be assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is evaluated using artificial experimental data from a model of the tumor necrosis factor signaling network. We demonstrate that the methods are computationally efficient and yield good estimation result even for sparse data sets.},

@article{2011_kalita_brasier_JBC,
	Abstract = {The canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway controls a gene network important in the cellular inflammatory response. Upon activation, NF-κB/RelA is released from cytoplasmic inhibitors, from where it translocates into the nucleus, subsequently activating negative feedback loops producing either monophasic or damped oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic dynamics. Although the population behavior of the NF-κB pathway has been extensively modeled, the sources of cell-to-cell variability are not well understood. We describe an integrated experimental-computational analysis of NF-κB/RelA translocation in a validated cell model exhibiting monophasic dynamics. Quantitative measures of cellular geometry and total cytoplasmic concentration and translocated RelA amounts were used as priors in Bayesian inference to estimate biophysically realistic parameter values based on dynamic live cell imaging studies of enhanced GFP-tagged RelA in stable transfectants. Bayesian inference was performed on multiple cells simultaneously, assuming identical reaction rate parameters, whereas cellular geometry and initial and total NF-κB concentration-related parameters were cell-specific. A subpopulation of cells exhibiting distinct kinetic profiles was identified that corresponded to differences in the IκBα translation rate. We conclude that cellular geometry, initial and total NF-κB concentration, IκBα translation, and IκBα degradation rates account for distinct cell-to-cell differences in canonical NF-κB translocation dynamics.},

@article{2010_luan_varner_MolBioSys,
	Abstract = {The role of mechanistic modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether uncertain models could be used to understand how a network responds to a therapeutic intervention. As a proof of concept, we modeled and analyzed the response of the human coagulation cascade to recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) and prothrombin (fII) addition in normal and hemophilic plasma. An ensemble of parametrically uncertain human coagulation models was developed (N = 437). Each model described the time evolution of 193 proteins and protein complexes interconnected by 301 interactions under quiescent flow. The 467 unknown model parameters were estimated, using multiobjective optimization, from published in vitro coagulation studies. The model ensemble was validated using published in vitro thrombin measurements and thrombin measurements taken from coronary artery disease patients. Sensitivity analysis was then used to rank-order the importance of model parameters as a function of experimental or physiological conditions. A novel strategy for the systematic comparison of ranks identified a family of fX/FXa and fII/FIIa interactions that became more sensitive with decreasing fVIII/fIX. The fragility of these interactions was preserved following the addition of exogenous rFVIIa and fII. This suggested that exogenous rFVIIa did not alter the qualitative operation of the cascade. Rather, exogenous rFVIIa and fII took advantage of existing fluid and interfacial fX/FXa and fII/FIIa sensitivity to restore normal coagulation in low fVIII/fIX conditions. The proposed rFVIIa mechanism of action was consistent with experimental literature not used in model training. Thus, we demonstrated that an ensemble of uncertain models could unravel key facets of the mechanism of action of a focused intervention. Whereas the current study was limited to coagulation, perhaps the general strategy used could be extended to other molecular networks relevant to human health.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical modeling of complex gene expression programs is an emerging tool for understanding disease mechanisms. However, identification of large models sometimes requires training using qualitative, conflicting or even contradictory data sets. One strategy to address this challenge is to estimate experimentally constrained model ensembles using multiobjective optimization. In this study, we used Pareto Optimal Ensemble Techniques (POETs) to identify a family of proof-of-concept signal transduction models. POETs integrate Simulated Annealing (SA) with Pareto optimality to identify models near the optimal tradeoff surface between competing training objectives. We modeled a prototypical-signaling network using mass-action kinetics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework (64 ODEs in total). The true model was used to generate synthetic immunoblots from which the POET algorithm identified the 117 unknown model parameters. POET generated an ensemble of signaling models, which collectively exhibited population-like behavior. For example, scaled gene expression levels were approximately normally distributed over the ensemble following the addition of extracellular ligand. Also, the ensemble recovered robust and fragile features of the true model, despite significant parameter uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that experimentally constrained model ensembles could capture qualitatively important network features without exact parameter information.},

	Abstract = {Computational models are increasingly used to understand and predict complex biological phenomena. These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated understanding of the system. However, development of useful models from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed. Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

Here, we review experimental and theoretical progress and future challenges toward this goal. We focus on how networks are reconstructed from data, how these networks are structured to control the flow of biological information, and how the design features of the networks specify biological decisions.},

	Abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that a single dose of 270 microg/kg recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may be a convenient, safe, and effective alternative to the repeat-dose regimen for hemophilia patients with inhibitors. Three recent trials investigating on-demand treatment (Kavakli et al 2006, Santagostino et al 2006, and Young et al 2008) lend further weight to earlier reports demonstrating that a single dose of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa is as effective as a repeat-dose schedule of 3 x 90 microg/kg rFVIIa in producing hemostasis, reducing the need for additional hemostatic medications, and improving pain and mobility in joints affected by hemarthroses. The single-dose regimen is advantageous as it may reduce both the difficulties caused by the need for repeated venous access and the interruption of daily activities associated with repeat dosing. Safety data from these three trials, along with those from a fourth study investigating the prophylactic use of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa, also demonstrate no additional or altered safety profile associated with single-dose treatment. These findings suggest that a single dose of 270 microg/kg rFVIIa is as safe and effective a hemostatic regimen as the standard lower, more frequent dose regimen and provides comparable bleeding control in hemophilia patients with inhibitors. The single-dose 270 microg/kg rFVIIa regimen utilized similar product consumption to the 3 x 90 microg/kg rFVIIa treatment regimen.},

	Abstract = {Information contained in this review of the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven) in the pediatric population was obtained through review of literature and abstraction of data available at Novo Nordisk. Pharmacokinetic investigations in hemophilic children suggest that rFVIIa may have a shorter half-life and more rapid clearance in the pediatric population than in adults, with resultant implications for dosing. Analysis of pediatric data from various studies and case reports indicates that rFVIIa is safe and effective for the control of spontaneous or surgical bleeding in hemophilic children with inhibitors, including central nervous system bleeds, and bleeding episodes during immune tolerance induction therapy. The very young pediatric population (less than 1 year of age) poses specific difficulties in treatment, and rFVIIa provides an effective alternative to other therapeutic modalities. In some hemophilia B patients with inhibitors, anaphylactic reaction to FIX infusions is a potentially life-threatening problem, for which rFVIIa may provide the only safe alternative therapy for the control of bleeding episodes. Continuous infusion of rFVIIa has also been used effectively in individual cases. Optimal dosing regimens, both intermittent and continuous, still need to be determined in children.},

This prospective, double-blind study compared rFVIIa (35 vs. 90 microg/kg) in the initiation and maintenance of haemostasis during and after elective surgery. Patients with inhibitors (FVIII, n = 26; FIX, n = 3) received rFVIIa immediately prior to incision; intraoperatively as needed; every 2 h for the first 48 h; and every 2-6 h for the following 3 days. Haemostasis was evaluated during surgery, at 0, 8, 24 and 48 h and 3, 4 and 5 days after wound closure. After day 5, open-label rFVIIa (90 microg/kg) was available for maintenance. Intraoperative haemostasis was achieved in 28/29 patients. All high-dose patients and 12/15 low dose patients had satisfactory haemostasis during the first 48 h. Twenty-three patients (13/14 high dose) successfully completed the study. Although the 35 microg/kg dose is probably sub-optimal for post-operative management, at least in major procedures, rFVIIa 90 microg/kg is an effective first-line option in surgery for patients with inhibitors.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) was developed to provide an improved procoagulant component capable of 'by-passing' inhibitor antibodies in the treatment of haemophilic patients. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two dosage regimens of rFVIIa (given intravenously at periodic intervals) in the treatment of joint, muscle and mucocutaneous haemorrhages in persons with haemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, international multicenter trial. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment A: 35 mu kg-1 or B: 70 mu kg-1, in blocks of 2. Within each block, one patient was assigned to the 35 mu kg-1 dosing regimen and the other to 70 mu kg-1 dose. One hundred and fifty subjects from 20 sites were screened for this study and 116 had baseline assessments. Of these, 84 were treated on the protocol and 32 were not treated in the study, in most cases because they did not return to the clinic with an eligible bleeding episode. One hundred and seventy-nine bleeding episodes were treated, of which 145 (81%) were acute haemarthroses. Both treatments were efficacious, with 71% having an excellent (59% and 60%) or effective (12% and 11%) response. Overall, the mean and median number of doses given per episode of joint bleeding were 3.1 and 2, respectively. The mean number of doses was 3.1 for the 70 mu kg-1 group and 2.7 for the 35 mu kg-1 group (P value = 0.142). The study concluded that rFVIIa in a dosage of 35 mu kg-1 or 70 mu kg-1 is both safe and reasonably effective in the treatment of joint or muscle haemorrhages in haemophilic patients with inhibitor antibodies to factor VIII or factor IX. It is concluded that the appropriate dose for the treatment of joint and peripheral muscle bleeding in haemophilic patients with inhibitors is 35-70 mu kg-1 given at 2-3 h intervals until haemostasis is achieved.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa) was developed for treatment of haemophilia patients with inhibitors against FVIII/FIX. The haemostatic efficacy rate of 80-90% including major orthopaedic surgery (dosing of 90-120 microg/kg every other hour [h] for at least the first 24 h) was achieved in these patients. In a home-treatment setting the efficacy rate of haemostasis in mild-moderate bleedings was 92% (average number of 90 microg/kg doses was 2.2). A wide individual variation regarding recovery of rFVIIa (46 +/- 12%; median 43%) as well as of clearance rate (36 +/- 8 ml/kg/h; median 32 ml/kg/h in adults; children 2-3 times higher) has been observed. Thus children may require higher doses than adults. Accordingly the use of a dose of 270 microg/kg in one single injection was approved in the EU. Recent experience indicates that repeated doses of rFVIIa may decrease the number of bleeds in "target joints", and thus may be useful as prophylaxis in severe hemophilia with inhibitors. Pharmacological concentrations of rFVIIa have been shown to enhance the thrombin generation on thrombin activated platelets in a cell-based model. By doing so a tight structured fibrin haemostatic plug resistant against premature lysis is formed. rFVIIa has been shown to induce haemostasis not only in haemophilia but also in other situations characterized by an impaired thrombin generation such as platelet defects, dilution coagulopathy developed as a result of trauma and extensive surgery. A special form of profuse bleeding, that may cause extensive problems is postpartum haemorrhage.},

@article{Tanaka:2009wo,
	Abstract = {Perioperative bleeding is a major challenge particularly because of increasing clinical use of potent antithrombotic drugs. Understanding current concepts of coagulation is important in determining the preoperative bleeding risk of patients, and in managing hemostatic therapy perioperatively. The serine protease thrombin plays pivotal roles in the activation of additional serine protease zymogens (inactive enzymatic precursors), cofactors, and cell-surface receptors. Thrombin generation is closely regulated to locally achieve rapid hemostasis after injury without causing uncontrolled systemic thrombosis. During surgery, there are major disturbances in coagulation and inflammatory systems because of hemorrhage/hemodilution, blood transfusion, and surgical stresses. Postoperative bleeding often requires allogeneic blood transfusions, which support thrombin generation and hemostasis. However, procoagulant activity and inflammation are increased postoperatively; thus, antithrombotic therapy may be required to prevent perioperative thrombotic complications. There have been significant advances in the management of perioperative hemostasis and thrombosis because of the introduction of novel hemostatic and antithrombotic drugs. However, a limitation of current treatment is that conventional clotting tests do not reflect the entire physiological processes of coagulation making optimal pharmacologic therapy difficult. Understanding the in vivo regulatory mechanisms and pharmacologic modulation of thrombin generation may help control bleeding without potentially increasing prothrombotic risks. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of hemostasis and thrombin generation using multiple, simplified models of coagulation.},
