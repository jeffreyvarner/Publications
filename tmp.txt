Biological processes are widely used in industrially to produce an array of products from commodity chemicals and to high-value protein therapeutics.
However, whole-cell processes share the central limitation of requiring cell growth, 
which redirects resources away from product synthesis, and cell walls, which complicate interrogation and control of intracellular metabolic processes.
On the other hand, cell-free metabolic systems offer many advantages over traditional in vivo production methods. 
For example, cell-free systems can direct scarce metabolic resources exclusively towards a single product of interest. 
Moreover, with no cell wall, cell free systems can more easily be interrogated, and substrates of the metabolite processes directly controlled.
Cell free production offers the unique opportunity to study metabolism without the complication of cell growth and gene expression processes.
For modeling, this implies that we need only consider allosteric regulation of enzyme activity when building and testing cell free metabolic models.
Of course, modeling allosteric mechanisms is itself a difficult problem when the model is at a whole genome scale. To address this problem, we have developed a
an approach based upon the constrained fuzzy logic framework of Morris and Lauffenburger [REFHERE].

As such, developing our effective modeling approach using these simple problems gave us valuable insight into the development of larger network models, 
without the complication of network size.

However, an easy workaround for competitive inhibitors, would be to modify the saturation coefficient in the kinetic component of our rate, $\bar{r}_{j}$ in \eqref{eqn:rate-factor} with
a control function.
