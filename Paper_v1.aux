\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Schematic of the connectivity of the reduced order coagulation model. A trigger compound e.g., TF/FVIIa initiates thrombin production (FIIa) from prothrombin (fII). Once activated, thrombin catalyzes its own activation (amplification step), as well as its own inhibition via the conversion of protein C to activated protein C (APC). APC and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibit initiation and amplification, while antithrombin III (ATIII) directly inhibits thrombin. All inhibition steps, and trigger-induced initiation were modeled using a rule-based approach. Likewise, the dependence of amplification on other coagulation factors was also modeled using a rule-based approach. The abundance of the highlighted species (in the dashed boxes) was governed by an ordinary differential equation. All other species were assumed to be constant.\relax }}{22}}

Traditional enzyme kinetic expressions e.g., Michaelis\IeC {\textendash }Menten or multiple saturation kinetics are multiplied by an enzyme activity control variable $0 \leq v_{j} \leq 1 $.
